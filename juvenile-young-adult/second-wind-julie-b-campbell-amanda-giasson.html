      <meta name="description" content="Megan and Irys have found themselves tangled in a web more intricate than either could have imagined. Sometimes you must stand against your enemies and sometimes you must befriend them if you want to survive.  ---  Irys:  The Masquerade was over but only now was I wearing the mask.  Everything appeared the same but to me it looked twisted and distorted. Megan was gone. I&#39;d failed both my friend and my Goddess. It was time for action. I would be a part of it.  ---  Megan:  I was trapped and afraid, but I wasn&#39;t alone. Warriors were all around me. Who could I trust? All I could hope was that Irys was safe and that Thayn would come for me.  Until then, I would do what I had to do.  *****  Second Wind is the action packed sequel to the first book in the Perspective book series by Amanda Giasson and Julie B. Campbell." />
