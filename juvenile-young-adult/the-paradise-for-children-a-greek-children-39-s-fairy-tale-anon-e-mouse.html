      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 346&lt;br /&gt;
In this 346th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the Fairy Tale &amp;quot;THE PARADISE FOR CHILDREN&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Long, long ago and far, far away, when this old world was in its tender infancy, there was a child, named Epimetheus, who never had either father or mother; and, that he might not be lonely, another child, fatherless and motherless like himself, was sent from a far country, to live with him, and be his playfellow and helpmate. Her name was Pandora.&lt;br /&gt;
The first thing that Pandora saw, when she entered the cottage where Epimetheus dwelt, was a great box. And almost the first question which she put to him, after crossing the threshold, was this,&amp;mdash;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Epimetheus, what have you in that box?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;My dear little Pandora,&amp;quot; answered Epimetheus, &amp;quot;that is a secret, and you must be kind enough not to ask any questions about it. The box was left here to be kept safely, and I do not myself know what it contains.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;But who gave it to you?&amp;quot; asked Pandora. &amp;quot;And where did it come from?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;That is a secret, too,&amp;quot; replied Epimetheus.What happened next you ask&amp;hellip;? Well many things happened, some silly and some serious. To find the answers to these questions, and others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;
Try as Pandora might her interest was aroused Until one day Pandora opened the box&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;..&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What was in the box you may ask? Did anything jump out and give her a fright? Well you could say so&amp;hellip;..But to find the answers to your questions, you will have to download and read this story.&lt;br /&gt;
