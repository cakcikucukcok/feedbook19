  <title>Firestorm - David Klass</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;His mother is not his mother. His father is not his father. But if Jack hadn&#39;t broken the high school rushing record that night, he never would have known and nothing would have changed. He&#39;d just be going out for pizza, playing football, trying yet again to score with his girlfriend, P.J. But he did break the record. He appeared on the news. And now they&#39;ve found him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jack plunges into a space-time-bending game of survival with no way out. The rules are shrouded in secrets. But one thing he learns fast: Trust no one. After centuries of abuse, the earth is dying, and it&#39;s up to Jack to reverse the decline before the Turning Point, when nothing will ever be the same again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beaten into shape by a ninja babe and a huge telepathic man&#39;s best friend, Jack hurtles across the ocean to save the future from the present and to solve the mystery of his purpose. Exactly who, or what, is Firestorm, and what does it have to do with Jack? And what comes next when everything you have ever known turns out to be wrong?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first book of the Caretaker Trilogy, readers are taken on an electrifying, fast-paced adventure of hunting truth, all in the name of staying alive.&lt;/p&gt;" />
