      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Camelot, King Arthur&amp;#8217;s dog encounters a world of danger and magic&amp;#8230;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow Cavall as he embarks on a quest that will put the unbreakable bond between a dog and his person to the ultimate test. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Cavall and his older brother, Glessic, leave the comfort of their simple barn to join the lavish court of Camelot, Cavall wants nothing more than to prove he&amp;#8217;s a good dog to the great knights and dogs of the castle&amp;#8212;especially to King Arthur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Gless says only the best dogs are worthy of greatness, and Cavall has never been as strong, brave, or fast as his brother. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, malevolent forces lurk in Camelot, and Cavall must figure out how to protect his person. To make matters worse, Arthur&amp;#8217;s mysterious nightmares are threatening to shake his grip on reality and undermine his authority as king.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To fight back against the dangers of the dream world, Cavall will need help from some loyal hounds and the enchanting, sometimes frightening creatures who call themselves the fay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this captivating debut from Audrey Mackaman, Cavall will have to prove not only that he can be a good dog for his person, but that he is capable of a greatness all his own.&lt;/p&gt;" />
