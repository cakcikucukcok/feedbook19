  <title>The Angel Pond - Sandy Malcore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Do you want to go to a magical place which expels all sadness, madness and badness? All you need to do is find &lt;em&gt;The Angel Pond.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a place the children in these stories know well. They decorate and populate the pond however they wish as youll see in twelve exciting adventures that lead to lessons about life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one adventure, Mercedes sees an angel named Faith who watches over the pond.  Mercedes asks for a unicorn. Be still, believe, and it shall come to you, the angel tells her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercedes soon sees a multicolored caterpillar, and as it gets closer, it becomes bigger and more beautiful  and then it talks! But thats nothing compared to the incredible transformation it makes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another story, a young boy thinks about his Uncle John who died in a thing called war. The last time they spoke, Uncle John promised theyd have fun together again. At the pond, the boy finds his uncle told him the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other adventures feature a blue elephant named Ella, a green giraffe with yellow stripes, and all sorts of seemingly unbelievable things. But the most important lesson is how to enjoy magic of your own at &lt;em&gt;The Angel Pond.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
