  <title>The Scarlets - Madeleine Roux</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this chilling e-original story set in the world of Madeleine Roux&#39;s &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling novel &lt;em&gt;Asylum&lt;/em&gt;, which &lt;em&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/em&gt; called &quot;a strong YA debut,&quot; one teen&#39;s descent into the ranks of a secret society leaves him with a secret he&#39;ll have to take to his grave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Dan and his friends meet Cal in &lt;em&gt;Sanctum&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8212;the sequel to &lt;em&gt;Asylum&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8212;their impression of the privileged New Hampshire College student is less than stellar. But Cal wasn&#39;t always the cold, sarcastic guy he is now. In this digital original story preceding the events of &lt;em&gt;Sanctum&lt;/em&gt;, we meet Cal when he is experiencing college like any other kid with a group of close friends and a dad who piles on the pressure. Only, when the pressure starts getting to him and Cal accepts an invitation to meet a selective group of students and alumni known only as the Scarlets, the course of Cal&#39;s life changes forever. And the price of joining the Scarlets might be higher than he can pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With plenty of twists, turns, and thrills, &lt;em&gt;The Scarlets&lt;/em&gt; is an exhilarating installment in the Asylum series that can stand on its own for new readers or provide a missing piece of the puzzle for series fans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epic Reads Impulse is a digital imprint with new releases each month.&lt;/p&gt;" />
