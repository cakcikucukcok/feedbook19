I, myself have cerebral palsy which caused me to get special attention sometimes in a negative way, which made me feel inferior or feel different. Writing has helped me believe anything is possible. I hope this book is enjoyed as much as I have enjoyed as much as I have enjoyed writing it. I have applied different areas of situations and how to look at it in a positive way.
