  <title>Zach&#39;s Tracks: A Yorkie&#39;s Adventure - Juliana Morgan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A true canine adventure, told from his perspective.   Author, Juliana Morgan said that she can not remember a time growing up when she didn&#39;t have an animal. Her father kept them in good supply of the furry critters, bringing home a Siamese cat, dogs, horses and even a lamb. Responsibilities of taking care of the animals fell on her and her siblings, which brought her even closer to knowing and understanding them.   As Juliana so aptly puts it, &quot;There is nothing like the bond you can have with your pet.&quot;  Morgan is also the author of Buddy Gets a Second Chance and Who Rescued Who? Sashi&#39;s Story, chapter books written for young readers. Both are excellent family character-building books with stories that will delight and entertain." />
