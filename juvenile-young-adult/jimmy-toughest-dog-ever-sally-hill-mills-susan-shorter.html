  <title>Jimmy: Toughest. Dog. Ever. - Sally Hill Mills, Susan Shorter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Its hard being a runt. Harder still if youre missing one of your legs. Makes you pretty sure no family would adopt you. None of the other dogs in the shelter even wants to play with you. Makes you just want to put your head down, close your eyes, and give up. But Jimmy will find out that he can belong to a family and a pack of dogs and that even though life is really hard sometimes, life is good. Dont ever give up.
 A rich reading experience for elementary school children.  A great classroom book full of lessons about language and life.
 Kirkus Reviews
 Celebrates difference and inclusion.  It is a perfect way to teach advocacy and empathy to kids and adults alike.
Cindy Lafon, Family Liaison, Parents Reaching Out, Albuquerque
 Jimmy teaches children and grown-ups that everyone  deserves a safe and loving home, and that if you have that as the backdrop for your life you can overcome enormous challenges.
