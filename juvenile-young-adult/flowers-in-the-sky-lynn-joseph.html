  <title>Flowers in the Sky - Lynn Joseph</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just about everyone from my country, Rep&amp;#250;blica Dominicana, dreams of moving to New York City, except for me. On the flight to New York, my first time on a plane, my first time away from Mami, I was finally free to cry. But nothing came out. I watched as the green mountains of my beloved island slipped away far below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifteen-year-old Nina Perez is faced with a future she never expected. She must leave her Garden of Eden, her lush island home in Samana, Dominican Republic, when she&amp;#39;s sent by her mother to live with her brother, Darrio, in New York, to seek out a better life. As Nina searches for some glimpse of familiarity amid the urban and jarring world of Washington Heights, she learns to uncover her own strength and independence. She finds a way to grow, just like the orchids that blossom on her fire escape. And as she is confronted by ugly secrets about her brother&amp;#39;s business, she comes to understand the realities of life in this new place. But then she meets him&amp;#8212;that tall, green-eyed boy&amp;#8212;one that she can&amp;#39;t erase from her thoughts, who just might help her learn to see beauty in spite of tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the acclaimed author of the color of my words comes a powerful story of a girl who must make her way in a new world and find her place within it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
