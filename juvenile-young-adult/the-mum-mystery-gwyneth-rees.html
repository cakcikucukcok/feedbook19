  <title>The Mum Mystery - Gwyneth Rees</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The third book in Gwyneth Rees’s bestselling ‘Mum’ series Esmie has always longed for a new mum, since her real mother died when she was a baby. So when Lizzie moves in, Esmie is delighted. Surely it can only be a matter of time before Dad proposes and Lizzie becomes an official mum. So why does Matty, Esmie’s brother, suddenly have cold feet about the whole thing? But Esmie has even more pressing problems: like the discovery of her mother’s old jewellery box that leads to a mystery about her past. And then there’s Esmie’s friendship with a new girl in the street who claims to have psychic powers…. Esmie has always loved mysteries – but never before have her detective skills been so thoroughly put to the test! Biographies Gwyneth Rees is half Welsh and half English and was brought up in Scotland. She is a qualified child and adolescent psychiatrist and has worked in various places, including Birmingham and London. The author of MERMAIDS, FAIRY DUST, FAIRY TREASURE, FAIRY DREAMS, FAIRY GOLD, COSMO AND THE MAGIC SNEEZE, COSMO AND THE GREAT WITCH ESCAPE, THE MUM HUNT (winner of the Younger Novel category at the Red House Children&#39;s Book Awards 2004), THE MUM DETECTIVE, THE MUM SURPRISE (WBD 2006), MY MUM&#39;S FROM PLANET PLUTO and THE MAKING OF MAY, Gwyneth is now writing full-time.
