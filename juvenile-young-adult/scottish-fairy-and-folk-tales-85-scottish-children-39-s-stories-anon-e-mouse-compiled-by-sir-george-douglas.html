  <title>SCOTTISH FAIRY AND FOLK TALES - 85 Scottish Children&#39;s Stories - Anon E. Mouse, Compiled by Sir George Douglas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book, compiled by Sir George Douglas, contains not just fairytales but also tales of kelpies, brownies, stories of animals - foxes, crows, frogs and stories of mermen and comic tales as well.&lt;br /&gt;
Contained herein are eighty-five stories like:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The Story of the White Pet,&lt;br /&gt;
The Fisherman and the Mermen,&lt;br /&gt;
The Seal-Catcher&amp;rsquo;s Adventure,&lt;br /&gt;
The Frog and the Crow,&lt;br /&gt;
Habitrot, The Wee Bunnock &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
and many, many more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the days long before the advent of radio and television, the arrival of a story-teller in a village was an important event. As soon as it became known, there would be a rush to the house where he was lodged, and every available seat--on bench, table, bed, beam, or the floor would quickly be appropriated. And then, for hours, together--just like some first-rate actor on a stage--the story-teller would hold his audience spell-bound with the tales contained herein.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
John Campbell of Isla, who gathered the &lt;i&gt;Popular Tales of the West Highlands &lt;/i&gt;series in the 1870&amp;rsquo;s, records that in his day the practice of story-telling still lingered in the remote Western Islands of Barra at that time. Maybe, just maybe, there are a few alive today who remember this custom being continued at Poolewe in Ross-shire where the young people used to assemble at night to hear the old ones recite the tales which they, in turn, had learned from their fore-fathers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book is a treasure chest of classic Scottish Folklore, and will make fascinating reading for those interested in folklore in general. So, take some time out and travel back to a period before television and radio, a time when tales were passed on orally--at the drying kilns, at the communal well and in homes and cottages of Scotland.&lt;br /&gt;
