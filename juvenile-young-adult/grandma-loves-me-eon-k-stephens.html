  <title>Grandma Loves Me - Eon K. Stephens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I believe that stories read to children should teach moral values that will impact their lives. Children need to be taught how to appreciate and express their love and gratitude to their parents and grandparents. However, it is the parents responsibility to nurture, teach, and provide for their children. Grandparents have a very important role as well. With their love and support, they can provide reenforcement and validation. Grandma Loves Me: Yes Im Sure, Thats Why I Appreciate Her So is a story of a little boy expressing his love to his grandma, whom he as grown close to. The story provides a series of memorable experiences that occurred in his life. It is illustrated through a lioness and a lion cub. At the back of the book, there is a Kids&#39; Learning Time section. This is an easy way for children to learn some unfamiliar words in the book. Children can also study the alphabet, colors, pictures, the days of the week, shapes, and the names of different fruits and vegetables. There is also a page for the child to use his imagination by coloring some pictures from the story." />
