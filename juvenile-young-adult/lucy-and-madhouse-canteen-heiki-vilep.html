  <title>Lucy and Madhouse Canteen - Heiki Vilep</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Mum said that this cat had boiled cauliflower instead of brains,&quot; Madeline remembered. Mum had said this when Edward Norton had slipped while taking curve on the slippery parquet floor and hit the wall really hard. &quot;Let&#39;s just call him Eddie then,&quot; the girls decided in the end. So this is how Edward Norton became Eddie and soon enough, everyone got used to the new name. But William, or Tim, called him by an even shorter name - Ed...  ...Granny had just come back from visiting a friend and stood at the door of the children&#39;s room, eyes wide open. Little Tim was also singing along in a high voice: &quot;Fa-la-laa, fa-la-laa...&quot; &quot;What kind of a madhouse canteen is this?&quot; Granny asked. &quot;This is a madhouse, indeed!&quot; Andy said and kept on singing. Since Granny was singing in a choir, she didn&#39;t give it a second thought but sat on the floor and joined them. &quot;Oh my God!&quot; Mum said in the other room. &quot;Where have I ended up now?&quot;" />
