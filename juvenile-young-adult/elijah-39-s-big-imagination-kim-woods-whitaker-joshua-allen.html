  <title>Elijah&#39;s Big Imagination - Kim Woods-Whitaker, Joshua Allen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Elijahs Big Imagination - A ball of an adventure is a picture book created in the spirit of a childs imagination. The book celebrates a little boys interaction with his toys. The encounter begins as Elijah opens his toy box and is surprised by a talking soccer, tennis, and football. The talking balls begin to complain of being squashed and made uncomfortable after Elijah loses his balance and accidentally falls in the toy box with the toys. As Elijah embraces the the concept and excitement of talking balls, he and his football head off for an adventure. Little do they know; the real excitement is yet to be had. The book represents the collaboration of a mother and her son. To bring this picturebook to life she encourages her son to use his imagination as he acts out the adventures that shape this story. Growing up with seven sisters and brothers, the author attempts to encourage her young son in the joy of creativity. The book encourages all parents and those involved with teaching and coaching youth to help build a vibrant imagination. We hope that Elijahs Big Imagination will be enjoyed by all." />
