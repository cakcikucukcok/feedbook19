  <title>I Am with You All Ways - Marian S. Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="FOR YEARS, MARIAN has been spending time in nature and taking photographs during many of these excursions. Sometimes she would be spending time in prayer and reflection, and other times she would just be pointing her camera and snapping pictures, only to find amazing visuals when she would get them developed. This book has been on her mind through years of seeing spirit in nature and in photos taken on these excursions. This book is written in a poetry format as a piece of childrens literature. The words allow a lilting pentameter, which is enhanced by paintings of real photographs that undeniably show the presence of spirit in this world. She wants to share her belief that Spirit is everywhere in everything." />
