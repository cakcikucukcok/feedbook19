  <title>Bigfoot’S Little Feet - Maggie O&#39;Donnell, Mark Ruben Abacajan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Everybody knows about Bigfoot, even your great-aunt Agnes! But what most people dont know is that Bigfoot isnt very big. Hes actually quite small, so small that youre probably taller than him! This is why most people never see him, because he can quickly duck into small shrubbery without being noticed.
Most people think he has glowing red eyes. This is also not true. Bigfoots eyes are chocolate-brown.
However, the legends did get one thing right: his feet are very, very big. So big that theyre twice as long as he is tall!
Deep in the woods, where all the Foots live, there was one Bigfoot whose feet were not very big. They were only half as long as he was tall. His name was Toby.
Every morning, before school, Toby would take his dads big shoes and stuff them with pillows so that his feet would look bigger. But his mom always caught him before he could get out the door.
Poor Toby always got made fun of because of his small feet. The other Foots never let him sit by them or play with them. They teased him and called him little foot, which hurt his feelings." />
