  <title>The Adventures of Jack and Jim - C. Gordon Thomas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="During the Great Depression, before the advent of gang wars or dope, work was not easy to find, if not impossible. It was a catastrophic period where people in this great country of ours were drawn together because they were all in the same boat. Neighbor helped neighbor. It was not be unusual for a neighbor to borrow a cup of sugar, if they had it, from the lady across the street. Nor would it be unusual for a family member to walk two miles out of his way to save three cents. It is in this atmosphere that our story takes place. The scene is Indianapolis, Indiana, and at times Danville, Illinois, but it could be any other part of the United States. 
Jack and Jim are two young, newly teenage boys in their formative years who are not fully aware of the calamitous period they are living in. The boys find themselves immersed in a tangle of exciting and sometimes frightening adventures. They think of ways they can earn money to help themselves and their parents. It seems almost natural. Therein lies the beauty of their story. Each chapter is based upon the real episode with a small amount of fiction added. The enduring friendships and the things of value in life emerge as the boys challenge the unknown. Young people search for the experiences like these because of the excitement. Lessons can be learned. The story illustrated how the freedom to make unregimented decisions within reason during childhood can help to develop integrity and mature young minds. Some of the stunts are somewhat dangerous and probably should not be attempted." />
