  <title>Ravage - Jeff Sampson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The war against BioZenith is on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the weeks since she first came into her mysterious new superpowers, Emily has watched one of her packmates disappear through an interdimensional portal; she&#39;s been hunted by creepy, body-snatching shadowmen; she&#39;s managed to form an alliance with the same telekinetic cheerleaders who once tried to take her down; and she&#39;s even discovered that her believed-to-be-dead mother is one of the BioZenith scientists responsible for her strange abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now it&#39;s up to the Deviants to put together the last pieces of the puzzle, which includes tracking down their final missing member and forcing their parents to reveal why they mutated their own children. Emily fears the answer is far more sinister than anyone ever thought: After all, why would a parent risk a child&#39;s life unless the stakes were high&amp;#8212;scary, world-ending high? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tired of being at the mercy of adult conspiracies, Emily forms a plan with the other Deviants: Destroy BioZenith before anyone can use the knowledge within the facility to aid the shadowmen. But that&#39;s only if BioZenith&amp;#8212;or something worse&amp;#8212;doesn&#39;t capture them first. . . . &lt;/p&gt;" />
