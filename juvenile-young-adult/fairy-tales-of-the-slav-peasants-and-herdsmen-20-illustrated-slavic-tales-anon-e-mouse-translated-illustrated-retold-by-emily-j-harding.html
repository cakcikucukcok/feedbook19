  <title>FAIRY TALES OF THE SLAV PEASANTS AND HERDSMEN -20 illustrated Slavic tales - Anon E. Mouse, Translated, Illustrated &amp; Retold by Emily J. Harding</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Originally published in French, Fairy Tales of the Slav Peasants and Herdsmen features 20 folk tales from the Slavic countries and territories. Very few of the 20 fairy tales included in this volume have been presented before in an English dress; this will doubtless enhance their value in the eyes of the young folk, for whom, principally, they are intended.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Herein you will find tales like The Twelve Months - the story of Marouckla, who is set seemingly impossible tasks by her stepmother, but with the help of the Twelve Months overcomes and succeeds. The Lost Child &amp;ndash; the story of a childless Noble couple who pray earnestly for a child. Their wish is granted with one condition &amp;ndash; that that the child&amp;rsquo;s feet never touched the earth until it was twelve years old&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip; Then you have the stories of The Sovereign of the Mineral Kingdom, Ohnivak, Tears of Pearls, Kinkach Martinko and many more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Slav race is considerably diverse, both genetically and culturally. Famous Slavs in recent times are Pope John Paul II, the first human astronaut Yuri Gagarin, former President of Russia Mikhail Gorbachev and electrician/inventor Nikola Tesla. In earlier times Slavic groups also migrated as far North as Scandinavia, and constituted elements amongst the Vikings; whilst at the other geographic extreme, Slavic mercenaries fighting for the Byzantines and Arabs settled Asia Minor and even as far East as Syria.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fairy Tales of the Slav Peasants and Herdsmen was a French collection of the beloved fairy tales passed from generation to generation, and the stories were collected for preservation by Chodzko. Emily Harding, also known as Emily Harding Andrews, published her English translation in 1896, Harding was an illustrator for the woman&amp;rsquo;s suffrage movement, and frequent illustrator of children&amp;rsquo;s books. Fairy Tales of the Slav Peasants and Herdsmen was the first book she had translated and published under her own name. The accompanying 55 illustrations and headpieces speak for themselves, and are what might have been expected from the artist of her calibre.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So sit back in a comfy chair with a cup of hot chocolate and enjoy these forgotten tales, lost to Western readers for over 100 years.&lt;br /&gt;
