  <title>Confused Hearts - Claudia Piano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This novel is not a fantasy and doesn’t belong to the saga of “Armonia”.&lt;br/&gt;
It is located in Liguria between Alassio and Genoa but we’ll make a trip also to London and…a bit around the world.&lt;br/&gt;
It is a light and romantic story which begins during an afternoon of early Summer.&lt;br/&gt;
What is it about? Love, intese feelings, sometimes confused, overwhelmed by emotions.&lt;br/&gt;
The protagonists are a young man and a young woman, friends since ever, engaged in their lives, absorbed by their passions, intent on building their future and dealing with their feelings, but…&lt;br/&gt;
Let the characters present themselves…&lt;br/&gt;
“Hello, I am Elisa, I am twenty-five, my friends call me Eli, I am Lili only for him…Fabri, that is, Fabrizio, my friend since ever…&lt;br/&gt;
“Lili, my Pulcino, let me speak…if we must convince some sweet and adorable girls to read our story I think I am the best suited for this task”.&lt;br/&gt;
“Sure, sure…how presumptuous he is…”&lt;br/&gt;
“What? Excuse me?”&lt;br/&gt;
“Nothing, go on”.&lt;br/&gt;
“So…what can I tell you? Lili is a wonderful angel, I adore her but she has a very bad taste as regards men or, perhaps, she is a bit unlucky”.&lt;br/&gt;
“Maybe…”&lt;br/&gt;
“And what can I say of me? I sing and play in a band in London, girls lose their heads for me. Pay attention not to lose yours too…”&lt;br/&gt;
“…”&lt;br/&gt;
“Why are you laughing?”&lt;br/&gt;
“Oh, nothing…you know I adore you”&lt;br/&gt;
The plot&lt;br/&gt;
Elisa and Fabrizio are friends since ever, there has always been a deep and intense feeling but while growing up they have taken a step back.&lt;br/&gt;
Each of them has followed its own path. Now Elisa is engaged, has got a bookshop at Alassio together with Elena, her best friend, and the role of second bassoon in Carlo Felice orchestra in Genova while Fabrizio works in a multinational in London and plays in a rock band.&lt;br/&gt;
They have always been best friends and continue " />
