      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Katie Minerva, a curious young girl growing up in the village of Sumneytown in the late 1800s, once again finds herself caught up in adventure and thrust into an enchanted place where things are not always as they seem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, after buying her favorite lemon twists from Bindlehofs Grocery, Katie meets a tree full of owls on one of her fishing excursions along the Ratty Fly. These owls inform her that one of her lemon twists isnt what she thinks it is, and when a magical wind steals it away, Katie knows they must be telling the truth. Now the town believes that the owls are bringing everyone bad luck. Meanwhile, a mysterious gypsy woman is also searching for the magical spiral that is not a lemon twist, and only time will tell if Katie can keep the promise that she made to the owls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this fantasy tale, one adventurous girl sets out to solve her towns problem of bad luck, assist a group of owls, and retrieve a magical item from a strange gypsy woman.&lt;/p&gt;" />
