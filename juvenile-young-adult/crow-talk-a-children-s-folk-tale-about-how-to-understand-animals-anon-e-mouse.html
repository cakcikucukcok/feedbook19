  <title>CROW TALK - A Children’s Folk Tale about how to understand animals - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 341&lt;br /&gt;
In this 341st issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the Fairy or Folk Tale &amp;quot;CROW TALK&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
ONCE upon a time, long, long ago and in a town far, far away, a murder of crows sat in the branches of a tree have a discussion.&lt;br /&gt;
Underneath, Dickie Dorn lay on his back chewing a stem of grass and watched and listened to the crows trying to decipher what they were saying. But try as he might all he heard was caw, caw, caw.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fedup with the constant cawing he made his way back doen the hill to his grandmother&amp;rsquo;s cottage. He asked her if she could speak and understand the language of the crows.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Ah&amp;rdquo; says she. &amp;ldquo;Just a moment.&amp;rdquo; She went to a shelf and brought down a bottle which contained a purple liquid. Fetching a teaspoon she put a few drops on the spoon and said to Dickie &amp;ldquo;Now open wide and suck the liquid off the spoon.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Trusting his Grandmother he did and then asked, &amp;ldquo;What was that for Grandmama?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;A good question&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;It will help you understand the language of the crows.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Ooer&amp;rdquo; said Dickie and followed it up with an absent-minded thanks before dashing out the door and going back up the hill to the great Oak tree.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Well, what did he hear the crows say? But is it a good idea to be able to understand what the birds of the air and animals of the field have to say? Maybe he heard things he shouldn&amp;rsquo;t hear.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, what happened next you ask&amp;hellip;? Well, a few things happened, some silly and some serious. To find the answers to these questions, and others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;
