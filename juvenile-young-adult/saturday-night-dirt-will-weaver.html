  <title>Saturday Night Dirt - Will Weaver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a sizzling summer Saturday, and Headwaters Speedway has suddenly become the place to be. Thanks to rainouts across the state, this small-town dirt track is drawing both big-time stock cars and local drivers. There&#39;s Trace Bonham, whose Street Stock Chevy is acting up in a big way. And Beau Kim, whose &quot;stone soup&quot; Modified has been patched together from whatever parts he could scrape up. And no one could forget Amber Jenkins, a strawberry blonde who has what it takes to run rings around them all. Keeping everyone on track is Melody Walters, who knows that the impending rain might be exactly what they need to keep her father&#39;s speedway afloat--or sink it for good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Will Weaver&#39;s high-revving novel, the first in the Motor series, a cast of car-obsessed teens and adults are all out to prove themselves, both on and off the quarter-mile track, as they move through their day on a collision course to meet on Saturday night dirt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Saturday Night Dirt&lt;/i&gt; is a 2009 Bank Street - Best Children&#39;s Book of the Year.&lt;/p&gt;" />
