  <title>Short Stories and Tall Tales - Roger J., Wilma J. Burnett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Short Stories and Tall Tales tells of the bummer days of eight young people.  Some days are normal living experiences and others are the result of over active imaginations with suspense and a touch of the paranormal thrown in for good measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Saturday Morning Surprise	page 1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brianna is twelve and talks her dad into having her own Puppy.  She quickly discovers a part of puppy ownership she hadnt planned on..  Only her active imagination can rescue her from this dilemma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Toboggan Hill			Page 25&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Josh and his brother Ethan have an advanced case of sibling rivalry.  Who will be the fastest down Toboggan Hill, the steepest and most treacherous hill in town?  Will one get hurt, like last year?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Visit.				Page 37&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isabel wakes up in the dark of the night to discover her Grandmother and a friend Miss Daisy are in her bedroom room and dressed as witches.  If that&#39;s not scary enough, Miss Daisy has had a memory lapse and can&#39;t remember how to reverse the spell she&#39;s cast on Isabel&#39;s brothers, Josh and Ethan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Halloween				Page 51&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nates favorite holiday was Halloween, until  the night he met a real ghost called Steadly.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Dreaded Pantry Door.	Page 65&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenzees friend Goody shares a secret that she keeps hidden behind the kitchen pantry door in her house.  If parents find out, it could change the lives of every kid in the neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Paces and Pits			Page 75&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aynslee and her siblings, agree to help their Grandfather test an experimental super modern ultra-reality computer game.  The computer somehow beams them inside as real pieces of the game and now they must find the secret to getting out.&lt;/p&gt;" />
