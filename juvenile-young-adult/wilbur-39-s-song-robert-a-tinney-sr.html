  <title>Wilbur&#39;s Song - Robert A. Tinney Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wilbur&#39;s Song&lt;/strong&gt; is the story of Wilbur, a young, yellow canary who cannot sing at all. By a series of unfortunate events, he is trapped by a great falcon named Franco and is prevented from migrating south for the winter with his family. He is all alone to spend the freezing winter in the Town of Courage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is befriended by a 13 year old girl and her four siblings, who take him into their home for the winter. Wilbur soon meets the family&#39;s Rottweiler &quot;Achoo&quot; who is old and weak. Wilbur brings the dog back to life as they go through adventures together. Achoo teaches Wilbur how to connect his heart to his song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilbur&#39;s Song was originally called &quot;Wilbur the Yellow Bird&quot;. A story the author had made up to tell his oldest daughter Amanda. Soon they were joined by Samantha, Bobby, Sadi and Cody. The author added all the kids into the story and their Family Rottweiler. As the children grew up together, Wilbur was their most requested story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wilbur&#39;s Song&lt;/strong&gt; is dedicated to the children, the great black and tan dog and the little yellow imaginary bird that tied it all together and touched their hearts.&lt;/p&gt;" />
