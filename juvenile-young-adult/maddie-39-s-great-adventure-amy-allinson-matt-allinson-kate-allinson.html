  <title>Maddie&#39;s Great Adventure - Amy Allinson, Matt Allinson, Kate Allinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
Taking your first trip away from home can be a scary thing to do,
especially if you&#39;re a pug puppy named Maddie, and there&#39;s a hurricane
on the way!  &lt;b&gt;Maddie&#39;s Great Adventure&lt;/b&gt; is the true story of how a pug
from New York gets on a plane with her parents and flies to Florida for
a sunny vacation. She is fearful at first, but Maddie quickly finds
exciting things to see, smell, and do in this unusual place.  As soon as
her paws hit the warm cement, her curly tail starts wagging, and she
feels the breeze on her whiskers.
&lt;P&gt;No sooner than she begins to enjoy the palm trees and colorful bugs,
dark clouds and thunder blanket the sky.  Hurricane Charley is what
Maddie hears, as she and her family spend the next day indoors.  There&#39;s
lightning and more water than most pugs ever see, and then the
electricity goes out.  Her Dad has to light candles, and Maddie tries
barking at the noises outside.  All she really wants to do is to go home
to her favorite bed.
&lt;P&gt;When Maddie awakes the next morning, she is surprised at what she sees:
a break in the clouds, birds chirping, and finally the sun!  Hurricane
Charley is gone.  With not a cloud in sight, she flies back home to New
York, bringing her vacation and her adventure to an end. Maddie will
always remember her great adventure. No one ever knows how the wind will
blow, but Maddie learns that listening, being brave, and staying near
the ones you love will help you weather any kind of storm.
