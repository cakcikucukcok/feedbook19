  <title>Reluctant Paladin - Jordan Bernal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;All Niall wants is to stay out of trouble at his new school, but Thorin, the school bully, has other ideas. When Niall comes home sporting bruises and asking for money, his grandfather&amp;#39;s suspicions grow, but Niall won&amp;#39;t open up about his troubles. To gain Niall&amp;#39;s trust, his grandfather recruits him to help care for Grayson, a newborn, wingless dragonet&amp;mdash;himself a victim of cruelty and prejudice. Niall bonds with the dragonet and swears his allegiance to the Tuatha dragon clan. Now he must keep the dragon clan a secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thorin struggles to care for his six younger siblings while dealing with the death of his mother and the fallout brought on by his father&amp;#39;s grief. Too young to shoulder the burden, he grows more desperate as his father&amp;#39;s destructive behavior puts the family in jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Niall endures the taunts and physical harassment until Thorin discovers Niall&amp;#39;s unique pendant. Then he is forced to do what is right: stand up to his fears and confront the bully in order to protect a centuries old secret&amp;mdash;dragons really do exist!&lt;/p&gt;" />
