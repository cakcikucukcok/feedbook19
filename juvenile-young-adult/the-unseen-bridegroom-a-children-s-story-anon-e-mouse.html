  <title>THE UNSEEN BRIDEGROOM - A Children’s Story - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 294&lt;br /&gt;
In this 294th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; series, Baba Indaba narrates the fairy tale of &amp;ldquo;THE UNSEEN BRIDEGROOM&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Long ago and far, far away there was a king and queen, and they had three daughters, all of them beautiful; but the most beautiful of all was the youngest whose name was Anima.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now it happened one day that all three sisters were playing in the meadows, and Anima saw a bush with lovely flowers. As she wished to carry it home to plant in her own garden she plucked at the root and plucked and plucked again. At last it gave way, and in the hole beneath, she saw a stairway going down farther into the earth. Being a brave girl and very curious as to where this could lead to? So without as much as a word to her sisters, she crept down the stairs&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What did she find you ask? Was it like Alice in Wonderland? Does she meet people and other beings? The answer to your questions is &amp;ldquo;Yes and more besides.&amp;rdquo; Download and read the story of Anima and her adventures beneath the earth.&lt;br /&gt;
I hear one last question, &amp;ldquo;Did she ever return home?&amp;rdquo; Well, be patient and download the story and find out for yourself!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue also has a &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - use Google maps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
