In this 211th issue of the Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories series, Baba Indaba narrates the French story of How Aurore Dupin Learnt To Ride.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On leaving the convent (see Baba Indaba Issue 210) Aurore returned home to Nohant, Indre Department, Central France to live with her Grandmother, for the first time seeing the world through the eyes of woman. Now being addressed as &amp;#39;Mademoiselle&amp;#39;, she finds it difficult to return to the activities of her childhood. Madame de Pontcarr&amp;eacute; and her old friend, Pauline, arrive for a visit. Later Hippolyte, now a dashing young hussar, returns to spend his leave at Nohant and that&amp;rsquo;s when things really began to change.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
More than a competent horseman, he decides to teach Aurore to ride. She soons finds commands shouted at her, like &amp;#39;Sit up straight&amp;#39; and &amp;lsquo;Stop slouching&amp;rsquo;. Aurore heard and obeyed with all her might. Five or six times she was jerked upwards out of the saddle, but she always returned to it again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When Hippolyte returned to his regiment, Aurore could be found riding with Collette on the commons visiting relatives and sick friends. Returning from one of these rides Collette and Aurore have to cross a river at a ford, and that&amp;rsquo;s when disaster stuck&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;.&lt;br /&gt;
You are invited to download and read another real-life story about Aurore and her riding escapades as she learns how to ride.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
