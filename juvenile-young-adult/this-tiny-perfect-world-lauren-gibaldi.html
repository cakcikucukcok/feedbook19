  <title>This Tiny Perfect World - Lauren Gibaldi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The&amp;#160;big-hearted story of a small-town girl who discovers how wide the world really is during one transformative summer. Perfect for fans of Susane Colasanti and Sarah Dessen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Penny loves her small-town Florida life, and she has her future mapped out. She&amp;#8217;s going to community college after graduation to stay close to home and her best friend, Faye. She&amp;#8217;ll take over the family diner that her dad has been managing since her mother died. And one day, she&amp;#8217;ll marry her high school sweetheart, Logan. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;br/&gt;But when she unexpectedly lands a scholarship to a prestigious summer theater camp, she is thrust into a world of competition and self-doubt. And suddenly, her future gets a little hazy. As she meets new friends, including Chase, a talented young actor with big-city dreams, she begins to realize that maybe the life everyone (including her) expects her to lead is not the one she was meant to have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the acclaimed author of &lt;em&gt;The Night We Said Yes&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Autofocus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
