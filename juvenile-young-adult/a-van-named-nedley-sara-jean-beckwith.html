  <title>A Van Named Nedley - Sara Jean Beckwith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Nedley was a van, and he was very lonely. He was battered and old and kept hidden in the back of a used car lot. He never thought he would find a family to care for him until, one day, three hairy young men came wandering up to his door and bought him! Nedley couldnt have been more excited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He soon found out his new family was called Leisurely Eagle. They were a band, and they loaded all their instruments into Nedley and hit the road. They sang songs and sometimes even let him sing along by honking his horn. Nedley was ready to take his family anywhere they needed to go until &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One night, Nedley starts to feel warm--too warm. His family realizes he needs to take a rest, but they have so many concerts to perform! They need Nedley to be in good health for their band to succeed. Will a night of rest be enough to get them back on the road, or will Nedley lose the family hes come to love?&lt;/p&gt;" />
