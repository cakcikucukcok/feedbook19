  <title>Not Now, Not Ever - Lily Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;AN INDIE NEXT PICK!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jennifer E. Smith meets &lt;i&gt;The Fangirl&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy&lt;/i&gt; in Lily Anderson&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Not Now, Not Ever&lt;/i&gt;, a deliciously nerdy companion to &lt;i&gt;The Only Thing Worse than Me Is You&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;ONE OF &lt;i&gt;Paste&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s BEST YOUNG ADULT BOOKS IN NOVEMEBER 2017&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;A wonderful book.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;School Library Journal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elliot Gabaroche is very clear on what she isn&#39;t going to do this summer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. She isn&#39;t going to stay home in Sacramento, where she&#39;d have to sit through her stepmother&#39;s sixth community theater production of &lt;i&gt;The Importance of Being Earnest&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;2. She isn&#39;t going to mock trial camp at UCLA.&lt;br&gt;3. And she certainly isn&#39;t going to the Air Force summer program on her mom&#39;s base in Colorado Springs. As cool as it would be to live-action-role-play &lt;i&gt;Ender&#39;s Game&lt;/i&gt;, Ellie&#39;s seen three generations of her family go through USAF boot camp up close, and she knows that it&#39;s much less Luke/Yoda/&quot;feel the force,&quot; and much more one hundred push-ups on three days of no sleep. And that just isn&#39;t appealing, no matter how many Xenomorphs from &lt;i&gt;Alien &lt;/i&gt;she&#39;d be able to defeat afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What she &lt;i&gt;is &lt;/i&gt;going to do is pack up her determination, her favorite Octavia Butler novels, and her Jordans, and run away to summer camp. Specifically, a cutthroat academic-decathlon-like competition for a full scholarship to Rayevich College--the only college with a Science Fiction Literature program, and her dream school. She&#39;s also going to start over as Ever Lawrence: a new name for her new beginning. She&#39;s even excited spend her summer with the other nerds and weirdos in the completion, like her socially-awkward roommate with neon-yellow hair, and a boy who seriously writes on a typewriter and is way cuter than is comfortable or acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only problem with her excellent plan to secretly win the scholarship and a ticket to her future: her golden-child, super-genius cousin Isaiah has had the same idea, and has shown up at Rayevich smugly ready to steal her dreams and expose her fraud in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This summer&#39;s going to be great.&lt;/p&gt;" />
