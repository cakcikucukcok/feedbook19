  <title>For Black Girls Like Me - Mariama J. Lockington</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In this lyrical coming-of-age story about family, sisterhood, music, race, and identity, Mariama J. Lockington draws on some of the emotional truths from her own experiences growing up with an adoptive white family.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;I am a girl but most days I feel like a question mark.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Makeda June Kirkland is eleven years old, adopted, and black. Her parents and big sister are white, and even though she loves her family very much, Makeda often feels left out. When Makeda&#39;s family moves from Maryland to New Mexico, she leaves behind her best friend, Lena-- the only other adopted black girl she knows-- for a new life. In New Mexico, everything is different. At home, Makeda&#39;s sister is too cool to hang out with her anymore and at school, she can&#39;t seem to find one real friend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Through it all, Makeda can&#39;t help but wonder: &lt;i&gt;What would it feel like to grow up with a family that looks like me?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Through singing, dreaming, and writing secret messages back and forth with Lena, Makeda might just carve a small place for herself in the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;For Black Girls Like Me&lt;/i&gt; is for anyone who has ever asked themselves: How do you figure out where you are going if you don&#39;t know where you came from?&lt;/p&gt;" />
