  <title>Time and Time Again - John Settle, Mircea Gabor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Adams father is a time-travel taxi driver for Chronos Travel, chauffeuring passengers forwards and backwards in time. For Adam, time-travelling with his father is normalboring, even. As far as Adam is concerned, he leads a normal life. He cycles with his friend, Don, or they both hang out at the skate park with Roslyn, eating ice creams, texting, and instant messaging. In September, the three friends were going to go back to school and continue their normal lives, like normal fourteen-year-olds do. All that is about to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frightened and desperate, Evelyn Walker runs into the time taxi seeking Adams help. In his moment of indecision, she is arrested. Unable to forget her, Adam searches for Evelyn, not knowing that if he finds her again, everything he once considered normalhis life, his friends, and even his worldcould be changed forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this science-fiction tale, two teenagers embark on a dangerous adventure through time and uncover a shocking truth about mankind that will cause them to question everything they have ever known about themselves.&lt;/p&gt;" />
