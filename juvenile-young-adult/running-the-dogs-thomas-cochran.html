  <title>Running the Dogs - Thomas Cochran</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In this heartwarming novel, a boy learns that even though life doesn&#39;t always follow your plans, things still sometimes turn out in a way that makes you glad to be in this world.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talmidge Cotton&#39;s daddy is the kind of person who believes Christmas presents are for Christmas, not two days before. So on the day before Christmas Eve, Tal still isn&#39;t sure he&#39;ll get what he wants most: the chance to run his three beagles in the woods at night all by himself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That afternoon it begins to snow, an almost unheard-of occurrence in Louisiana. Tal is excited by the strange and wonderful weather and the prospect of his first white Christmas, but then his dogs disappear into the gathering storm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next morning, they still aren&#39;t home. Even worse, the snow and ice have trapped his father in the southern part of the state, and it doesn&#39;t look like he&#39;ll make it home anytime soon. With Daddy and the dogs gone, everything seems wrong, and it sure doesn&#39;t feel like Christmas Eve . . .&lt;/p&gt;" />
