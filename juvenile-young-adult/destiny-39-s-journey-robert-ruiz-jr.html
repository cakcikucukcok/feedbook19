  <title>Destiny&#39;s Journey - Robert Ruiz Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Children and younger adolescents in todays world are bombarded with information from the electronic media and, in particular, the internet. Much of what they see and read has little redeeming social value. Computer games are particularly violent and teach the lesson that, in order to have your way, it is okay to resort to strength and violence. Robert Ruiz, Jr., in writing Destinys Journey, sought to provide children and youth with an imaginative adventure story rooted in the values of family and friendship that stand the test of time: love, joy, peace, kindness, gentleness, faith and patience. Inculcated in the story are the concepts of a Creator and a plan of life that is greater than any individual or group of individuals on earth. There is, indeed, a divine plan for all living things. 
The author, in developing the Chiles family, was particularly interested in engaging Mexican and Hispanic American children and youth, many of whom have been raised in the produce fields of Mexico and the United States. Thus, Chiles family characters serve as the vehicle to share values that make any society strong. The interdependence of the characters in this story clearly demonstrates that no man is an island, entire of it self. All of us need each other, regardless of race, age or background in order to not only survive but thrive in todays world. And above all, we must recognize that there is a higher power at work in each of our lives." />
