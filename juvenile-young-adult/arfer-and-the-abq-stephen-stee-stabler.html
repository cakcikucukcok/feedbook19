  <title>Arfer and the Abq - Stephen &quot;Stee&quot; Stabler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Arfer came into the world alongside five other puppies, two brothers and three sisters. He was smaller than all the rest. The little dog lived with his mother and family behind Teds Garage. It was discovered that although he was the smallest pup, he had the biggest voice. No one wanted to adopt Arfer, and his owner threatened to send him to the shelter.
Arfer was happy when Mr. Mann showed up to take him home. Arfer was so excited; he was going to be a companion for Mr. Manns wife, Mary Lou. The two turned out to be good friends, and Arfer learned a lot of tricks.
But Arfer was very inquisitive, and one day he escaped from the backyard. Running all over the city, he tried to find Mary Lou. He remembered she was going to the airport to pick up Mr. Mann. Arfer found himself in a scary situation and wondered if he would ever find his family. In the end, he was glad the Manns had a microchip put under his skin." />
