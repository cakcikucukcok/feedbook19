  <title>On the Road Again - Marie-Louise Gay, David Homel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the sequel to &lt;em&gt;Travels With My Family&lt;/em&gt;, the family is on the road again -- this time to spend a year in a tiny village in southern France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They experiences the spring migration of sheep up to the mountain pastures, the annual running of the bulls (in which Charlie&#39;s father is trapped in a phone booth by a raging bull), and other adventures large and small. Most of all, though, Charlie and his little brother, Max, grow fond of their new neighbors -- the man who steals ducks from the local river, the neighbor&#39;s dog who sleeps right in the middle of the street and their new friends Rachid and Ahmed, who teach them how to play soccer in the village square.&lt;/p&gt;" />
