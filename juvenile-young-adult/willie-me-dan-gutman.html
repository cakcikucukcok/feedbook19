But then Ralph Branca shows up in his room one night, begging for Stosh&#39;s help. In 1951, Branca pitched a ball to Bobby Thomson that would become the &quot;Shot Heard Round the World,&quot; a home run that won the National League pennant for the New York Giants and changed the lives of Branca and Thomson forever. Branca says the Giants were cheating, and he needs Stosh to use his power with baseball cards to go back in time and set things right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stosh is determined to help, but he quickly learns that you can&#39;t change just one little thing in history. If he erases the &quot;Shot Heard Round the World,&quot; he may forever alter the life of a young rookie named Willie Mays.  With wisdom from all the players he has helped before&amp;#8212;plus the surprise return of some familiar faces&amp;#8212;Stosh uses his power to travel in time using baseball cards one last time in a fabulous finale to the adventure of a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Correlates to the Common Core State Standards in the English Language Arts&lt;/p&gt;" />
