  <title>&quot;Beetle Bugs!  Beetle Bugs!  Beetle Bugs on Me!&quot; - Kimberly Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When was the last time you experienced an adventurous day? Were you grossed-out by anything? YUK!!! Did anything try to attack you? WOW!!! Eat you? EEEEK!! 
A little brother and sister have wild experiences on a summer day that are scary; especially, for the brother. This is not a normal day for them. Noooo. Not at all! Get up! Get up! is how theyre day begins. 
Imagine being excited about your special day only to be grossed out! What happens at the museum has you itching and scratching. The experience at the zoo has you screaming. How can a sparkling swimming pool turn into an infested dungeon? Then, just when you feel safe at home, what suddenly appears will make you jump up and down. 
Will the little brother and sister survive their adventurous day? Take a peek inside to see whats crawling around. 
This childrens book by Kimberly Williams, is not only creatively written, but is based on a real life, beetle bug fascination of her 2 yr. old grandson. Being that Kimberly also has a 1 yr. old granddaughter, his little sister, her character appears, as well, in the book. 
Beetle Bugs! Beetle Bugs! Beetle Bugs on Me! is an original! With Kimberly being a teacher, she amazingly crafted a Reflections Page for ages Pre-K through Grade 5. This added educational opportunity is an enticement for learning as it falls in alignment with the Texas Staar Test and the National Common Core Test." />
