  <title>The Secret of the Fortune Wookiee (Origami Yoda #3) - Tom Angleberger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;With Dwight attending Tippett Academy this semester, the kids of McQuarrie Middle School are on their own&amp;mdash;no Origami Yoda to give advice and help them navigate the treacherous waters of middle school. Then Sara gets a gift she says is from Dwight&amp;mdash;a paper fortune-teller in the form of Chewbacca. It&amp;rsquo;s a Fortune Wookiee, and it seems to give advice that&amp;rsquo;s just as good as Yoda&amp;rsquo;s&amp;mdash;even if, in the hands of the girls, it seems too preoccupied with romance. In the meantime, Dwight is fitting in a little too well at Tippett. Has the unimaginable happened? Has Dwight become normal? It&amp;rsquo;s up to his old friends at McQuarrie to remind their kooky friend that it&amp;rsquo;s in his weirdness that his greatness lies.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; This is the third case file in the blockbuster bestselling Origami Yoda series, written by Tom Angleberger, author of &lt;I&gt;Star Wars: Return of the Jedi: Beware the Power of the Dark Side&lt;/I&gt;&lt;I&gt;, &lt;/I&gt;showcasing his proven knack for authentically capturing the&amp;nbsp; intrigues, fads, and dramas of middle school in &amp;ldquo;a satisfying tale of friendship and just resistance to authority&amp;rdquo; (&lt;I&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/I&gt;, starred review).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;U&gt;Praise for &lt;I&gt;The Secret of the Fortune Wookiee&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/B&gt;has crafted a worthy follow-up to his break&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;B&gt;STARRED REVIEW&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;quot;Angleberger&amp;rsquo;s third in the series continues the fun.
