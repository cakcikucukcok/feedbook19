  <title>Georgette&#39;s Apple Bivortex Theory of Everything (A Grand Unified Theory of the Universe) - George William Kelly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;George William Kelly wrote this collection of eight childrens stories over the lifetime of his daughter, Georgette.  He named the heroines after her.  By the time he published the collection, Georgette had reached the age of &quot;sweet sixteen.&quot;  Consequently, some of the stories aim at picture book readers and some at teenage readers.  They reflect Georgettes growing older and older.  The stories range from how Santa Christina (Mrs. Santa Claus) saved Christmas by helping Santa Claus deliver the Christmas toys, to how Georgette discovered there are 32 tooth pixies instead of one tooth fairy, to how Georgettes family developed the idea of a &quot;grand unified theory of the universe&quot; from apples in their kitchen fruit bowl.  As a gift for Georgettes sixteenth birthday, Kelly combined his eight favorite stories into a print-on-demand paperback book (and an e-book) published by the Xlibris Corp.  Like many childrens books, this one offers food for thought to adults as well as to children.  It has no illustrations, but the author believes children will draw their own pictures.  He hopes that some of the stories may be republished later as individual picture books.  &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Georgettes Apple Bivortex Theory of Everything.  &lt;/B&gt;&quot;This story presents a model that shows how everything in the universe evolves,&quot; Kelly says.  &quot;Modern scientists have searched and searched for this model but have failed to see it.  Great scientists like Rene Descartes, Isaac Newton, Michael Faraday, James Clark Maxwell, Max Planck, Albert Einstein, and Niels Bohr circled close around this model, but even those giants failed to see it.&quot;  &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Georgettes bivortex theory evolved over sixteen years.  Georgette, her Mommy, and her Daddy were seeking one, single answer to a young girls unending questions about &lt;B&gt;everything&lt;/B&gt;.  Their amateur, commonsense approach led them further and further into the realms of astronomy, cosmology, mathematics, physics, and the history of science.  Although they could not speak the various scientific &quot;dialects,&quot; they could comprehend general scientific speculation about the universe.  They could also ponder the detailed pictures of the universe provided by space-age astronomy.  Just as a small child saw the real truth in the old fairy tale about the emperors new clothes, so Georgettes scientifically unsophisticated family saw in the apple-like shapes of certain space photographs a new model for a theory of everything:  a grand unified theory of the universe.  As far as the family  knows, this model never occurred to the scientists who have striven to harmonize red shifts, the Big Bang, the expanding universe, black holes, wormholes, gravity, electromagetism, curved space, strings, branes, quantum, matter, antimatter, dark matter, wimps, strong nuclear force, weak nuclear force, Bose-Einstein condensates, great walls, chaos theory, etc.  &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Georgettes bivortex model takes the shape of an apple in the center of a large cloud of particles.  It begins when two or more particles eddy around each other and form a tube.  This  rotating tube of particles sucks more and more cloud particles down the vortex at each end of the tube.  The opposing helical streams of particles collide at the tubes center.  The particles split, ricochet, and radiate outward to form an equatorial bulge and equatorial disk.  Nearly all these particles are drawn back eventually toward the rotating tube.  They rise in arched pathways northward and southward from the equatorial bulge and disk.  Some return quickly to the walls of the tube.  Others return leisurely via either the north pole vortex or the south pole vortex.  The particles recycle along the lines of the bivortex field, just as iron filings follow the lines of a magnets  electromagnetic field.  At the extreme circumference of the disk, some particles leave the system altogether and radiate into space.  Meanwhile, some particles pass the tubes center-point and follow the tubes axis in" />
