      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 318&lt;br /&gt;
In this 318th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the Fairy Tale &amp;quot;THE LITTLE GOOSE GIRL&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
ONCE upon a time, long, long ago and far, far away, a queen gave birth to a beautiful daughter. When she grew up, she was betrothed to a prince who lived a great way off; and as the time drew near for her to be married, she got ready to set off on her journey to his country. Then the queen, her mother, packed up a great many costly things&amp;mdash;jewels, and gold, and silver; trinkets, fine dresses, and, in short, everything that became a royal bride; for she loved her child very dearly: and she gave her a waiting-maid to ride with her, and give her into the bridegroom&amp;#39;s hands; and each had a horse for the journey. Now the princess&amp;#39;s horse was called Falada, and could speak.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When the time came for them to set out, the old queen went into her bed-chamber, and took a little knife, and cut off a lock of her hair, and gave it to her daughter, and said, &amp;quot;Take care of it, dear child; for it is a charm that may be of use to you on the road.&amp;quot; Then they took a sorrowful leave of each other, and the princess put the lock of her mother&amp;#39;s hair into her bosom, got upon her horse, and set off on her journey to her bridegroom&amp;#39;s kingdom.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But the maid sent to attend the Princesses needs has evil plans and almost immediately leaving the palace she starts treating the Princess with disrespect - and things begin to get worse&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip; But having no-one else to assist her, the princess has to make do with the scheming handmaiden until she gets to her new home. But does she get there or will the scheming handmaiden&amp;rsquo;s put an evil plan into action before they arrive&amp;hellip;.? To find the answers to these questions, and others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;
