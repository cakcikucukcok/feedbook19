      <meta name="description" content="When their Tokyo plane is grounded in Sydney, due to cabin mist, the Frequent Flyer Twins become involved in an oriental antique mystery.

What is the courier carrying in the briefcase chained to his arm and where do the R.P.G. group fit in?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;En route for Tokyo, the Frequent Flyer Twins solve a mystery." />
