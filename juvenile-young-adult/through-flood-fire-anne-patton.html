  <title>Through Flood &amp; Fire - Anne Patton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dorothy’s father has always dreamed of having his own farm. So, with the help of Dorothy, her family, and a community that comes together despite their different backgrounds, the Boltons set out with their wagons, horses, dogs, and belongings, to create a life for themselves on the vast prairie landscape. After travelling thousands of miles, Dorothy and her familyhave arrived in Canada, and are adjusting to their new lives on the prairies. Things are different than they were in England – even the small things like food and water have to be worked for – but Dorothy is excited for the adventure they’ve started.  However, the Barr Colonists who arrived with Dorothy and her family are getting restless. Lack of food and other resources have caused many families to fall ill and go hungry, and the prairie and its weather are unforgiving. Fire and floods consume homes and supplies, and many promises made to the Colonists before leaving England have proven false. Will this colony of settlers have what it takes to put down lasting roots in this strange new world?" />
