  <title>All for a Carrot - Glen Moller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever felt that what you want is just out of reach? Have those around you seemed only interested in themselves? Such are the problems faced by the unlikely hero of this book. 
The hero: a hungry horse. 
His problem: a magnificent carrot hanging from a stick -- but just out of his reach. 
He knows how to get it, but he will require help from a selfish lot of bystanders, each motivated by their own wants. How will he get that carrot? And what will be the reaction of those whose help he needs? 
Glen Moller and Marvin Paracuelles have created a funny and lyrical book, with beautiful illustrations. Enjoy!" />
