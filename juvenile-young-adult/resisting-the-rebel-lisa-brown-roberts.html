  <title>Resisting the Rebel - Lisa Brown Roberts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Spirit committee leader Mandy Pennington is secretly in love with her best friend, Gus, but when he hooks up with her archenemy at a party, she decides to win him over once and for all. She just doesn&#39;t know &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt;. But who better to help than hot loner Caleb Torrs?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Caleb&#39;s got his own problems, but when he sees Mandy pining over Gus at a party, he thinks she&#39;s finally smoked the spirit stick and lost her mind. Maybe he has, too, because he just asked Mandy to be his fake girlfriend. She&#39;ll get her loser friend&#39;s attention, and he&#39;ll get his stalker ex off his back. It&#39;s a win-win.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But soon one fake date blends into the next and before he knows it, he actually &lt;i&gt;wants &lt;/i&gt;to kiss Mandy. For real. Too bad their plan is working, and Gus is finally noticing the one girl Caleb just might be falling for...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disclaimer: This book contains a villain pretending to be a hero, a hero pretending to be a villain, a disco-dancing heroine, two overprotective sidekicks, a little bit of bad language, and a whole lot of swoony kissing.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
