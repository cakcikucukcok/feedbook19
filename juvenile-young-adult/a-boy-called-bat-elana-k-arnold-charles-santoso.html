  <title>A Boy Called Bat - Elana K. Arnold, Charles Santoso</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first book in a funny, heartfelt, and irresistible young middle grade series starring an unforgettable young boy on the autism spectrum, from &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;acclaimed author Elana K. Arnold and with illustrations by Charles Santoso.&amp;#160;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This chapter book is an excellent choice to share during homeschooling, in particular for children ages 6 to 8 who are ready to read independently. It&amp;#8217;s a fun way to keep your child engaged and as a supplement for activity books for children.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Bixby Alexander Tam (nicknamed Bat), life tends to be full of surprises&amp;#8212;some of them good, some not so good. Today, though, is a good-surprise day. Bat&amp;#8217;s mom, a veterinarian, has brought home a baby skunk, which she needs to take care of until she can hand him over to a wild-animal shelter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the minute Bat meets the kit, he knows they belong together. And he&amp;#8217;s got one month to show his mom that a baby skunk might just make a pretty terrific pet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;This sweet and thoughtful novel chronicles Bat&amp;#8217;s experiences and challenges at school with friends and teachers and at home with his sister and divorced parents.&amp;#160;Approachable for younger or reluctant readers while still delivering a powerful and thoughtful story&quot; (from the review by Brightly.com, which named &lt;em&gt;A Boy Called Bat&lt;/em&gt; a best book of 2017).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
