  <title>Kyd’S World - Ryder Stone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;At one time, Kyd was a high roller, a feared and respected kingpin drug dealer in Boulder, Colorado. Now, after twelve weeks in the Boulder County Jail, eight weeks in rehab, and six months in a Florida halfway house, he must face the demons in his life as he struggles between conforming to mainstream society and life in the black market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; As Kyd heads to Portland, Oregon to live with his mom while his legal issues play out, he re?ects on his life and the events that led up to his arrest in Boulder. Alone, in a solitary vacuum of guilt and remorse, he bares his battered, vulnerable soul as he contemplates the grave consequences he feels his actions have had on the people he truly loved. Kyd struggles as he wonders what makes him di?erent from the good people, the normal people, and is unabashed as he vehemently shares his loathing of society which conditions kids to want, to feel they need all its unrealistic bling to be happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shining a light into the darkness that is todays angry, disenfranchised youth, Kyds World lifts the veil exposing their insidious underworld as it jogs back and forth through the life of    twenty-?ve-year-old Kyd, a byproduct of twenty-?rst century Americas have-it-your-way generation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
