A king promised his dying wife that he would not marry unless to a woman as beautiful as she was. He realises that the only woman that would not break the promise was his own daughter.

When her father provides them castle on the eve of the wedding, she runs from the castle and sleeps in the forest. A prince, hunting with his dogs, finds her and she asks him to have pity on her and give her a place in his kitchens. Because she gave no name, she was called &amp;quot;All-Kinds-of-Fur&amp;quot; or Allerleirauh. The prince plans a ball and the princess sneaks in wearing her silver dress......&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;.
