She is both cross and sad when, each day that she goes to the pen, she sees there are no eggs for her to collect. 
Oh dear! she sighed, There are no eggs today. I need lots of eggs by Sunday, .. Because its Easter Day and you all know that we do something very special every year to celebrate. 
When Easter Day arrives there are still no eggs for the Easter Egg Hunt and all the children are disappointed ..Until, that is, they go into the garden and get a much unexpected surprise!" />
