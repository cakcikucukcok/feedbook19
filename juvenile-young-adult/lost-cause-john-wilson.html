Suddenly he&#39;s off to Spain, armed with only a letter from his grandfather that sends him to a specific address in Barcelona. There he meets a girl named Laia and finds a trunk containing some of his grandfather&#39;s possessions, including a journal he kept during the time he fought with the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War. Steve decides to trace his grandfather&#39;s footsteps through Spain, and with Laia&#39;s help, he visits the battlefields and ruined towns that shaped his grandfather&#39;s young life, and begins to understand the power of history and the transformative nature of passion for a righteous cause.&lt;br&gt;
