  <title>How Oscar Indigo Broke the Universe (And Put It Back Together Again) - David Teague</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#9733;&amp;#160;&quot;Suspend all disbelief and enjoy.&quot; &amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;Kirkus &lt;/em&gt;(starred review)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From David Teague, the coauthor of the critically acclaimed &lt;em&gt;Saving Lucas Biggs&lt;/em&gt;, comes a funny and sweet story about learning to have courage even when it feels like the world is ending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oscar Indigo has never been good at baseball, so naturally he&amp;#8217;s nervous when he has to fill in for his team&amp;#8217;s injured All-Star, Lourdes. Luckily, Oscar has a mysterious gold watch that can stop time, which he uses to fake a game-winning home run. Now Oscar&amp;#8217;s the underdog hero of his town and even Lourdes wants to be his friend. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But the universe is a precarious place, and you can&amp;#8217;t just steal time without any consequences. If Oscar doesn&amp;#8217;t find a way to return the time he stole, the universe will unwind completely. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oscar wants nothing more than to ask Lourdes for help, but what would a baseball star like her think of a guy whose fake home run actually destroyed the universe? But as he and Lourdes grow closer, Oscar understands that it isn&amp;#8217;t always what you do that makes you special&amp;#8212;but who you are. And that confidence just might be the key to fixing the universe.&lt;/p&gt;" />
