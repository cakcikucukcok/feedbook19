  <title>Peaches the Private Eye Poodle: Finding Foster a Home - Patricia D.  Hamilton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Peaches is a family pet poodle who has great powers to find things when no one else can. In Finding Foster a Home, Foster&#39;s family moved and couldn&#39;t take him along. He is put up for adoption and luckily is staying at Peaches&#39; Doggie DayCare until a new family can be found. Peaches puts on her &quot;private eye hat&quot; and along with her boyfriend, Mel, takes charge of finding Foster a new home. Did they succeed? Was Foster adopted by a new family? You&#39;ll have to read the book to find out! Look for other adventures of Peaches the Private Eye Poodle, such as Finding Dipsey Doodle, Where is Loosey Goosey? and The Missing Muffin Caper. Ms. Hamilton and Peaches live in a suburb of Atlanta, Georgia. She spent most of her working career at Delta Air Lines in both New York City and Atlanta. Prior to taking early retirement in 2003, she headed up Delta Air Lines&#39; Worldwide Sales Training Organization. Ms. Hamilton took early retirement to start her own successful corporate training company. She has been involved in writing interactive training materials for about twenty-five years and she also does keynote speaking on customer service. Ms. Hamilton has always wanted to venture into writing children&#39;s books and thought this might be the right time. When taking Peaches for walks, children are always running up to her because Peaches is so cute (said by a biased parent), so Ms. Hamilton thought she would put the two together and Peaches The Private Eye Poodle was born.
