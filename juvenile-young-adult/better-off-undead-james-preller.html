  <title>Better Off Undead - James Preller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;After becoming undead, a boy tries to survive middle school.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adrian Lazarus has met with a curious fate. He&#39;s returned from the dead (after a bad bike accident, no helmet), yet not a lot has changed. He&#39;s always been an outcast. But it&#39;s not just being a zombie that makes Adrian feel different. He notices the world has changed, too: bees are vanishing, forest fires are burning, super-flus are spreading. The holographic advertisements in the night sky assure people that all is well. Adrian and his friends - a beekeeping boy, a mysterious new girl, and a seventh-grade sleuth - aren&#39;t so sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they discover a birdlike drone has been spying on Adrian, the clues lead to two powerful corporate moguls. What do they really want?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Preller brings his singular humor to &lt;i&gt;Better Off Undead&lt;/i&gt;, a middle-grade zombie story that&#39;s about fitting in as much as it&#39;s about the end of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This title has Common Core connections.&lt;/p&gt;" />
