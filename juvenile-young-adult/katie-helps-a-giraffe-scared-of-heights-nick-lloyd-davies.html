  <title>Katie Helps....A Giraffe Scared of Heights! - Nick Lloyd-Davies</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Katie is 10 and, one day, on a school trip, she found a stone in her lunch box. 
But this is not just any old stone were talking about. 
Its bright green.
It glows.
And it writes messages to her. This glow-stone, as she has named it, has changed Katies life forever.
With its help and guidance, Katie has helped lots of animals, big and small, scary and cute, to get themselves out of trouble. Animals may be stuck up a tree. They may be bullied. They may be too cold. Some may just be lost or have run out of money (yes, animals do use money!).
In Katies first adventure, a giraffe is desperate for Katies help. The giraffe is terrified of heights and
is being dreadfully teased by his cruel brothers and sisters. Katie is magically transported by her glow-stone to Africa, where she teaches the bullies a lesson they wont forget!" />
