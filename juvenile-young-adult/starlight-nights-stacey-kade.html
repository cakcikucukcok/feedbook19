  <title>Starlight Nights - Stacey Kade</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this sizzling companion to the critically acclaimed &lt;i&gt;738 Days&lt;/i&gt;, Stacey Kade once again creates a masterful combination of romance, angst, and thrills in the backdrop of a Hollywood film set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At twenty-two, Calista Beckett is trying to overcome her early fame and fortune. The former savior of the world on &lt;i&gt;Starlight&lt;/i&gt; is now a freshman at college--miles away from L.A. and her former existence. She sees it as her start to a new life, a normal life, one where she won&#39;t make the same mistakes she made before--a brush with heroin addiction and losing her freedom to her controlling mother, thanks to a court order. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eric Stone played her older brother, Byron, on &lt;i&gt;Starlight&lt;/i&gt;. But she&#39;s been in love with him pretty much since they kissed--her first kiss--while auditioning. When Eric shows up on campus out of the blue, Calista&#39;s struck immediately by two things: first, in spite of everything that&#39;s happened, she still feels something dangerous for him, and second, she&#39;s absolutely determined not to let him ruin her life again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only Eric&#39;s not going away so easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
