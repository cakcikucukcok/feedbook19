  <title>Pants on Fire - Meg Cabot</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Katie Ellison is not a liar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s just that telling the truth is so . . . tricky. She knows she shouldn&#39;t be making out with a drama club hottie behind her football-player boyfriend&#39;s back. She should probably admit that she can&#39;t stand eating quahogs (clams), especially since she&#39;s running for Quahog Princess in her hometown&#39;s annual Quahog Festival. And it would be a relief to finally tell someone what really happened the night &lt;em&gt;Tommy Sullivan is a freak&lt;/em&gt; was spray-painted on the new wall outside the junior high school gymnasium&amp;#8212;in neon orange, which still hasn&#39;t been sandblasted off. After all, everyone knows that&#39;s what drove Tommy out of town four years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now Tommy Sullivan has come back. Katie is sure he&#39;s out for revenge, and she&#39;ll do anything to hang on to her perfect (if slightly dishonest) existence. Even if it means telling more lies than ever. Even if, now that Tommy&#39;s around, she&#39;s actually&amp;#8212;no lie&amp;#8212;having the time of her life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
