  <title>A Shark out of Water - Julie K. Halapchuk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;&quot;Well, it&#39;s mystery meat again. I&#39;m pretty sure the lunch ladies are stealing small animals from the neighborhood and using them to feed us.&quot; Nick laughed and said, &quot;I think you&#39;re right. I haven&#39;t seen the poodle that lives next door to us in over a week.&quot; Sammy took a bite and added, &quot;Well, if it is your neighbor&#39;s poodle, she tastes just like chicken.&quot;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Sammy is moving to a different town, starting sixth grade at a new school, and constantly arguing with his annoying older sister, Stacy. Could life for Sammy be any more stressful? Sure, if you add in the fact that he also has spina bifida.&lt;/p&gt;
Sammy isn&#39;t your typical kid, but after making a few good friends and joining the Springdale Sharks sled hockey team, everyone gets a chance to see how amazing he can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;I&gt;A Shark Out of Water&lt;/I&gt; highlights the love/hate relationship between siblings and touches on a subject that isn&#39;t always easy to discuss-what can happen when you&#39;re a little bit different?&lt;/p&gt;" />
