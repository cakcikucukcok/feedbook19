  <title>Ready to Fall - Marcella Pixley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A young adult novel about a teen who finds hope and a fresh start after a terrible loss, and learns that being strong means letting go.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Max Friedman&#39;s mother dies of cancer, instead of facing his loss, Max imagines that her tumor has taken up residence in his brain. It&#39;s a terrible tenant--isolating him from family, distracting him in school, and taunting him mercilessly about his manhood. With the tumor in charge, Max implodes, slipping farther and farther away from reality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, Max is sent to the artsy, off-beat Baldwin School to regain his footing. He joins a group of theater misfits in a steam-punk production of &lt;i&gt;Hamlet &lt;/i&gt;where he becomes friends with Fish, a girl with pink hair and a troubled past, and The Monk, an edgy upperclassman who refuses to let go of the things he loves. For a while, Max almost feels happy. But his tumor is always lurking in the wings--until one night it knocks him down and Max is forced to face the truth, not just about the tumor, but about how hard it is to let go of the past. At turns lyrical, haunting, and triumphant, &lt;i&gt;Ready to Fall&lt;/i&gt; is a story of grief, love, rebellion and starting fresh from acclaimed author Marcella Pixley.&lt;/p&gt;" />
