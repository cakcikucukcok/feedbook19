  <title>CUNNIE RABBIT, Mr. SPIDER and the OTHER BEEF - 51 African Tales and Stories - Anon E. Mouse, Compiled and Translated by Florence M. Cronise &amp; Henry W. Ward</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Herein are 51 illustrated African tales of Cunnie Rabbit, or Cunning Rabbit, Anansi the &amp;ldquo;Trickster&amp;rdquo; Spider and their mischievous antics they get up to with other animals in the West African Jungle.&lt;br /&gt;
The 51 stories are divided into 13 sections. These sections are not the usual well-ordered and self explanatory sections you would expect. Instead, they are arranged with typically African fashion and meaning. They are: When The Night Has Come With The Spirits Of The Wood A Back-Yard Kitchen Evening On The Water A Purro Initiation The Burning Of The Farm&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Mammy Mamenah And Her Friends Children Of Nature An Afternoon In The Barreh Konah Turns Story-Teller While The Birds Did Not Come A Harvest Home In Temne-Land (Northen Sierra Leone) Konah Has A Wonderful Day&lt;br /&gt;
Some of the stories interwoven into these sections are:&lt;br /&gt;
Mr. Spider Wins A Wife,&lt;br /&gt;
Goro, The Wonderful Wrestler,&lt;br /&gt;
Mr. Turtle Makes A Riding-Horse Of Mr. Leopard,&lt;br /&gt;
Cunning Rabbit And His Well,&lt;br /&gt;
Mr. Chameleon Is Transformed Into A Boat, as well as many others which include your typical array of African forest animals like Mr. Crocodile, Mr &amp;lsquo;Elephan, Mr. Pawpawt&amp;aacute;mus (hippopotamus) and many more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;But, Cunnie Rabbit&lt;/b&gt; is not in fact a rabbit in the true sense. Cunnie Rabbit is a small deer of the Duiker, or Dik Dik, variety of the family Cephalophinae of which there are 22 extant species.&lt;br /&gt;
So, no matter what time of year it is, pour yourself a hot toddy, pull up a comfortable chair, and sit back and be prepared to be entertained with this old-fashioned book of African folklore gathered by Florence M. Cronise and Henry W. Ward from Sierra Leone over a hundred years ago.&lt;br /&gt;
10% of the publisher&amp;rsquo;s profit from the sale of this book will be donated to Charities.&lt;br /&gt;
