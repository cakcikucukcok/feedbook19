  <title>Bun Bun Goes on Vacation - Robert M. Law</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When a little girls grandpa decides to take her pet white rabbit, Bun Bun, to live with him in a large cottage on his Wisconsin resort during the tourist season, neither one has any idea of the fun that lies ahead for both of them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though Bun Bun calls an old cage home, the grandpa also gives him a lot of freedom in the big cottage and the surrounding woods of Door County. From mysterious noises in the dark to the other animals that share the wilderness with him, Bun Bun begins an unforgettable adventure where he soon starts to believe he is a little more human than rabbit. As the self-proclaimed cottage kid learns how to swim, silently pleads for M&amp;Ms, and climbs atop a large wooden feeder near the back door, Bunny certainly makes himself at home. But what will happen to him once the resort closes for the winter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bun Bun Goes on Vacation shares the delightful tale and real-life photographs of a little white rabbits adventures at a cottage resort where he attempts to do everything the other children do.&lt;/p&gt;" />
