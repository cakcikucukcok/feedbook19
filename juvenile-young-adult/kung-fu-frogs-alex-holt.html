  <title>Kung-Fu Frogs - Alex Holt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Kung-Fu Frogs mission is fourth fold. Firstly, to introduce children from the ages of nine years and up to a positive, motivational, educational, entertainment experience.  
Secondly, and very importantly, to teach and/or remind children of the major mental benefits of the martial arts:  peace, justice, self-esteem, self-control, respect, confidence, discipline, gratitude, perseverance, and an indomitable spirit.  Studies have shown that when children apply these principles to their schoolwork, their grades greatly improve.  Kung-Fu was created to be a passive method of self-defense; and is based on studies of all life in nature.
Thirdly, a recent televised national academic test scores report revealed that urban children arent scoring as well as their suburban counterparts.  Many of these suburban districts have a wealth advantage.  However, the urban kids, upon graduation, will have to compete for the same college entrance procedures and in the same job markets as the children from wealthy districts.
	Therefore, all children, and especially the urban children, should apply the martial arts mental behavior principles to their lives, and schoolwork.  Peace, justice, self-esteem, self-control, respect, confidence, discipline, gratitude, perseverance, and an indomitable spirit.  Perhaps, these behavior traits, will surface as the real salvation for urban children when and where, there is less wealth applied for education.
	Fourthly, the martial arts provide people with a very good method of physical exercise for weight control, and over all good
physical health.  There is a childhood epidemic of obesity in
America today.  This obesity among very young people is creating life-threatening diseases, once found almost exclusively in adults:  hypertension, type2 diabetes, sleep problems, liver and gall bladder disease.
	Kung-Fu Frogs merge the long interest of children with frogs and their proven practice and love of the Martial Arts.  This merge is presented in an entertaining, motivational and educational context.
	The frog has appeared in many Chinese and Japanese folk tales.  One must remember that Kung-Fu was the first Martial Arts created and was taken from the movements of various animals.  This art form of self-defense was created to be passive and sought to teach self-control, confidence, discipline, perseverance, gratitude and an indomitable spirit. The Ninja art form was derived from Kung-Fu.
	The Kung-Fu Frogs are alien Kung Fu heroes.  They gained their super knowledge and skills of Kung-Fu by scanning the entire universe for all encompassing wisdom and truth through their super extra-sensory, telekinesis and telepathic abilities.  The frogs employ their flagship spacecraft, Star Exodus for encounters with their archenemies, the insects and their flag spaceship, Destructive Force and for intergalactic missions of peace, justice, health and education." />
