  <title>The Young Alchemists and the Vatican&#39;s Legion of Evil. - Norma Pastor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Young Alchemists and the Vaticans Legion of Evil is a great adventure of action, mystery, intrigue, romance and hilarity about a group of extraordinary teenagers who willingly and for the good of humanity decide to become the younger members of the Alchemists the most powerful secret organization in the world.
From the moment they first meet at the Roseford Academy, a prestigious yet very mysterious private school located in Bromptonville, New York, the group of six become inseparable, their curiosity, mischievousness and spirited love for adventure is an open invitation for the wildly unpredictable series of escapades that ensue. As they become deeply enmeshed in a world of mystery and intrigue, they are confronted with a series of seemly impossible challengesmuch more than they would bargained for had they known in advance what was in store for them. 
On March 6/2013 in one of the abandoned chambers of an ancient monastery in the Vatican, the newly indoctrinated Young Alchemists Pippa Steinberg, Allie McKay, Quan Sun, Cristian Gomez and their school friends Pepper Douglas and Pony McBride, find a letter hidden in an ancient leather book. At once they realize that the contents of the letter if ever publicly disclosed would permanently stain the reputation of the Holy Mother Church of Rome and endanger the lives of almost every inhabitant on planet earth.
The letter written in 1774 by a 75 year old Italian priest Father Alberto Giacalone, describes in detail the global plot of the Nonplus the most evil secret organization in the world with an evil agenda to corrupt all earthlings, dismantle all world religions and seize control of the planet." />
