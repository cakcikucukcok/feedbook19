  <title>The Lazarus Machine - Paul Crilley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Steampunk adventure for fans of Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Who An alternate 1895, A world where Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace perfected the Difference Engine. Where steam and Tesla-powered computers are everywhere. Where automatons powered by human souls venture out into the sprawling London streets. Where the Ministry, a secretive government agency, seeks to control everything in the name of the Queen. It is in this claustrophobic, paranoid city that seventeen-year old Sebastian Tweed and his conman father struggle to eke out a living. But all is not well. A murderous, masked gang has moved into London, spreading terror through the criminal ranks as they take over the underworld. As the gang carves up more and more of the city, a single name comes to be uttered in fearful whispers, Professor Moriarty. When Tweed&#39;s father is kidnapped by Moriarty, he is forced to team up with information broker, Octavia Nightingale, to track him down. But he soon realizes that his father&#39;s disappearance is just a tiny piece of a political conspiracy that could destroy the British Empire and plunge the world into a horrific war. From the Hardcover edition." />
