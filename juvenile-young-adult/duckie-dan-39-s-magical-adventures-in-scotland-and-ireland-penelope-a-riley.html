  <title>Duckie Dan&#39;s Magical Adventures in Scotland and Ireland - Penelope A Riley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Duckie Dans Magical Adventure in Scotland and Ireland &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duckie was off on another adventure. Grandma Hattie took him to Scotland and Ireland to see the land where her family lived many years ago. While Granny was searching for relatives, Dan was searching for magical things that he had read about.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It was difficult to sleep that night in a new country, new beds, and many dreams of dragons, knights, castles, and a serpent named Nessie, the Loch Ness Monster. She was not really a monster but was a big serpent that people saw from time to time. Dan wanted to see her. Finally he drifted off to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;" />
