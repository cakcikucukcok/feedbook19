  <title>Life Revelations - It Begins with an End - Simonne Tracia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Remember that not getting what you want is sometimes a wonderful stroke of luck.
 Dalai Lama
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
At a crossroad where all my dreams and everything in my life were shattered, I knew I had failed terribly in my life and bad enough that I wanted to end my life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Suicide was on my mind, but it was not the solution to all the
problems, to any life crisis, be it emotional, mental, physical, or social.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you want your life to change, new choices and actions must be aligned to your desired future.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Each new day is an opportunity to fulfi l your dreams and potentials.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Emptiness is a symptom that you are not living life creatively. You either have no goal that is important enough to you or you are not using your talents and efforts in striving for an important goal.
 Maxwell Maltz
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Live the life that you want... make that change
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Its your place in the world; its your life. Go on and do all you can with it, and make it the life you want to live." />
