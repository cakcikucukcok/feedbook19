  <title>Seeking New Possibilities?  Be a Search Consultant! - Terre Davis PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Experiencing the process of interviewing for a school superintendent
position was challenging, to say the least. In my experience, I was appalled
by the lack of professionalism and organization shown on the part of the
school districts. I made notes of how I thought the interview process should
be conducted and put my notes away, thinking that someday I might want to
do something regarding the professional interview process.
&lt;br&gt;
Upon retirement from serving as a public school superintendent for nearly
twelve years, I referred to the notes I had made during the interview process
and determined that there was a need in this professional arena. I did research
and then started my own company for the purpose of doing superintendent
searches with boards of education. I have completed over one hundred
individual searches and feel that I have developed and perfected a process
that is second to none. I have decided that I need to share the information and
experiences I have gained so that others may benefi t through my process.
&lt;br&gt;
I feel that in the very near future, many boards of education are not going to
have the funds to hire a consultant to assist them in a superintendent search;
therefore, I would like to make available a search process which has been very
successful for the past twenty-plus years.
&lt;br&gt;
The decision in hiring a new superintendent is the most important decision
a board will ever make; therefore, the process to get to the right decision is
extremely important. Many boards think it is just a simple matter and try to do
it on their own without specifi c guidelines. What a mistake!
&lt;br&gt;
This book is a step-by-step method with all materials suited to the specifi c
needs of the district, whether a small, rural, large, urban, charter, or private
school. Here, the author also discusses the materials as valuable and appropriate
in searching for a college dean or working with a private company.
&lt;br&gt;
This book would be extremely valuable to, and is intended for, boards of
education, any corporation, or any other organization in the public or private
sector seeking a process for hiring the next superintendent, university dean, or
corporate CEO, and as a textbook or reference material for university graduate
studies.
&lt;br&gt;
While searching for publications of a similar nature, I have found this book
to be unique and have no rival.
