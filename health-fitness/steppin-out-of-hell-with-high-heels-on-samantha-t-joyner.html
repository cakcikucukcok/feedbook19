  <title>Steppin out of Hell with High Heels On - Samantha T Joyner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Simone Johnson has lived in hell and back again. She realizes
that living in Hell becomes a continuous life style for her. She
must love it because she keeps dating online meeting the same
types of men with the same types of problems. Simone is ready to
live a new life style with a different kind of love. She now has to pay
the price for all her past mistakes. She does not realize that the best
man for her has been sitting in front of her all along. Can she stop
looking for online love to see whats right in front of her or will she
continue paying the price to live in Hell? Simone has to change
her mindset and stop looking for Mr. Right Now in order for Mr.
Right to come along.
Gordon Wilson is a educated man and one of the most gorgeous
available men in the town of Rochester New York. Gordon is a
church going man, professional man and a successful business
man. He has a past like most of us and he allows his mother to
have a part in it all. He has to come to terms with living in hell
continuously or stepping out to conquer all things in his life. His
main problem is that he uses his church image to attract women.
Gordon is now on the hunt for a wife but he has some demons he
has to conquer before moving forth into yet another relationship.
Sinclair Rogers was totally out of control in her life. She starts out a
professional dancer and ends up a stripper. She wants out of the
game but does not know how to let go the glamor and the money.
She wants a normal life, children and a man who can truly love
her. Will she find a life of love in the strip club or will she have to
turn her life over to a higher power to get control of all the HELL
thats showing up in her life.
You shouldnt find someone else until you find yourself. - Will Koz" />
