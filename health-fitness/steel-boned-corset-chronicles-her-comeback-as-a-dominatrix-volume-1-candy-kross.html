  <title>Steel Boned Corset Chronicles: Her Comeback as a Dominatrix Volume 1 - Candy Kross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I was out running errands; shopping, the bank, dry cleaning pick-up, the usual Monday morning duties. I had just done my grocery shopping and was walking in the parking lot to my car. I heard a deep familiar voice calling my name, &quot;Melissa! Melissa!&quot;    I turned around and it was my old friend from over twenty years ago. He looked the same too! &quot;Oh my god!&quot; I yelled out. &quot;You haven&#39;t changed one bit!&quot; I never knew his real name, he had always gone as Master Azrael and he was about ten years older than I was.     I&#39;m 44 years old now, but when I was in my early twenties, I went under his wing and performed as a Dominatrix for him in his dungeon. We caught up on our lives over a cup of coffee later and he informed me that he had been in the Dominating business all this time but he was ready to retire.     He had asked me if I would ever be interested in taking over the dungeon. Wow. That was a big responsibility, I thought to myself." />
