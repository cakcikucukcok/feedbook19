  <title>The Power to Actualize Your Dreams - Nelly Chinenye Reuben</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this book, the author has counselled on working out dreams, redeeming silent dreams, and maintaining focus in the period of trials. You will discover: 
 The classes of talent discovery 
 The nature of dreams you have 
 Challenges of dreamers 
 Self-motivation to maximize your talent 
 The power of focus 
 The power of imagination 
 The power of small beginning 
 Building an intimate relationship with God
 And lots more
I have read through this book and found the contents not just interesting but highly educative. I recommend it to everyone who wants his/her life to count beyond the lifespan here on earth. It is a must read for those who want to be news makers rather than news watchers.
Mrs. Margret N Okoro
 H/Reps, National Assembly.  Abuja
This is an inspirational book that unfolds real life principles backed up with scriptural truth and wisdom. It is a must read for everybody that want to live their lives according to Gods will.

This is a unique motivational book that speaks to the youth in the language they will understand and powerfully directs them to the greatest motivator-God: who gives the dream, focus, strength and enthusiasm to actualize it

I have known the Author from her childhood. Her life is a replica of what she has written in this book. Inspire yourself to greater heights by reading this book! While it is impossible to get the whole knowledge in the library, it is possible to get the most from this handy book.

The author captures inspirational and motivational truths in easy to comprehend and applicable to life issues, in all ramifications. The book is a compendium of wisdom and counsel.
