  <title>Love, Dating, Relationship and Sex. Top Secrets You Need to Know - Stacy Philips</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Love in any relationship brings with it many expectations and much hope. Being loved unconditionally is the paramount dream of many great people. When you are loved unconditionally it means you are accepted for whom you are and for what you are, having a sense of belonging and acceptance, the feeling of being protected and safe. But most of all it means deep rooted intimacy, romance and passion united by an everlasting bond.&lt;br /&gt;
The fact is that the two people involved in a relationship are different. They have different needs, different expectations and different directions. However it is important to understand that the disenchantment that follows the discovery of this reality is expected, and is an unavoidable step on the pathway to finding true love and happiness. You just need to work on it.&lt;br /&gt;
Today everyone wants an understanding, loyal &amp;amp; honest partner with whom one can be and share ups &amp;amp; downs of life. Looks always do not become important. At the end, life is all about compromises. Man is a social animal &amp;amp; cannot stay alone. He needs to be with someone, and to find someone is not easy. Relationship starts when you love someone and want to spend your entire life with that person you want your partner to accept you as you are and build a strong relation.&lt;br /&gt;
Love is not a game. You cannot deliberately fall in love or make anyone else fall in love. If you feel you are really attracted towards a person wait some time until you figure out if it is really love or just another infatuation. Infatuation fades away with time but real love gets even stronger.&lt;br /&gt;
Once you know you are truly in love with someone only then you can move forward towards a relationship. Remember that it takes years to build a relationship while it only takes a moment for it to break. And a broken relationship will only hurt you for the rest of your life.&lt;br /&gt;
Relationship is the act of friendship. It is what occur between two or more peoples who move together or do thing in common. Relationship occurs between lovers, between parent and children, between employer and employee, once there is an agreement, there exist a relationship, even between a master and a servant. Relationship keeps the world going.&lt;br /&gt;
But with time love and the relationship may get into the wrong pathway. Hope dies and in place of love comes anger, frustration and loneliness. When you are in the honeymoon phase of your relationship, feelings are often based on lust and the illusion that the two of you will get together as one. But as time passes by this perfect image fades and the dream is ruined.&lt;br /&gt;
To overcome most challenges in relationship and to know most secrets of a successful relationship read, buy and recommend this book to people who are in search of a better relationship .&lt;br /&gt;
