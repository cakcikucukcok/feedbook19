  <title>The Kind Self-Healing Book - Amy Eden Jollymore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If you are prone to anxiety, depression, self-doubt, people-pleasing, or decision-making influenced by fear, or if you want to free yourself of the coping behaviors that worked in a disordered childhood but don&amp;#39;t serve you in adulthood, &lt;em&gt;The Kind Self-Healing Book&lt;/em&gt; is for you. If you grew up within a chaotic family environment caused by chronic inconsistency, stress, and emotional or physical abandonment or abuse&amp;mdash;whether due to addictions, political unrest, war, or a parent&amp;#39;s mental health issues&amp;mdash;&lt;em&gt;The Kind Self-Healing Book&lt;/em&gt; is for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an adult child of alcoholics and the founder of the influential blog Guess What Normal Is, author Amy Eden Jollymore understands the importance&amp;mdash;and the particular challenges&amp;mdash;of nurturing self-care and self-love, having embarked on the complex journey herself. As a result, this candid and sympathetic book invites readers to take a courageous look inside their hearts and minds, guided by sensitivity and love, so they may discover how some of their unconscious behaviors are hurting them. Even in the center of some very raw emotion, you will find that the book&amp;#39;s guidance and activities are gentle&amp;nbsp;every step of the way, allowing you to cultivate great self-compassion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In examining the reactive, defensive, isolating, and safety-seeking behaviors that all adult children of alcoholic, addicted, or otherwise narcissistic and childlike parents have always utilized&amp;mdash;simply as learned habits or survival mechanisms&amp;mdash;you will begin a personal transformation of deep love and growth. With whimsical and calming illustrations and a design that welcomes participation, &lt;em&gt;The Kind Self-Healing Book&lt;/em&gt; encourages you to write your thoughts, feelings, and observations on its pages&amp;mdash;inspiring, guiding, and supporting you throughout in making the kinds of changes that will enable you to lead the happier, more functional, and overall more balanced life you&amp;#39;ve always wanted.&lt;/p&gt;" />
