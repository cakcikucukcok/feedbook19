  <title>The Art of the Good Life - Rolf Dobelli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Since antiquity, people have been asking themselves what it means to live a &lt;i&gt;good life&lt;/i&gt;. How should I live? What constitutes a &lt;i&gt;good life&lt;/i&gt;? What&#39;s the role of fate? What&#39;s the role of money? Is leading a &lt;i&gt;good life &lt;/i&gt;a question of mindset, or is it more about reaching your goals? Is it better to actively seek happiness or to avoid unhappiness? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each generation poses these questions anew, and somehow the answers are always fundamentally disappointing. Why? Because we&#39;re constantly searching for a &lt;i&gt;single &lt;/i&gt;principle, a &lt;i&gt;single &lt;/i&gt;tenet, a &lt;i&gt;single &lt;/i&gt;rule. Yet this holy grail--a single, simple path to happiness--doesn&#39;t exist. Rolf Dobelli--successful businessman, founder of the TED-style ideas conference Zurich Minds, bestselling author, and all-around seeker of big ideas--has made finding a shortcut to happiness his life&#39;s mission. He&#39;s synthesized the leading thinkers and the latest science in happiness to find the best shortcuts to satisfaction in &lt;i&gt;The Art of the Good Life&lt;/i&gt;, his follow up to the international bestseller &lt;i&gt;The Art of Thinking Clearly &lt;/i&gt;(which has sold more than 2.5 million copies in 40 languages all around the globe). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Art of the Good Life&lt;/i&gt; is a toolkit designed for practical living. Here you&#39;ll find fifty-two happiness hacks--from guilt-free shunning of technology to gleefully paying your parking tickets--that are certain to optimize your happiness. These tips may not guarantee you a good life, but they&#39;ll give you a better chance (and that&#39;s all any of us can ask for)." />
