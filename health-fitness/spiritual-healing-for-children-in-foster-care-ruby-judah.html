  <title>Spiritual Healing for Children in Foster Care - Ruby Judah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This childrens book is a motivational and spiritual book for children and teenagers. It was written to help inspire and heal the children that come from the dysfunctional juvenile dependency court and family court systems in the United States of America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This system hurts both dysfunctional families and non-dysfunctional families. While there is real child abuse going on within families, there are also families that are falsely accused of breaking child abuse laws. It is no wonder state and federal judges have stated,  our youth is out of control in this country, and it is chilling. If our society does not do something to help these children and families, we will lose the battle with our children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spiritual Healing for Children in Foster Care seeks to help those children that are feeling lost, alone, isolated, abandoned, and frightened. They may be feeling different from other children when they are not, or feeling suicidal because they feel like nobody cares about them. Author Ruby Judah wants these children to know that they are loved and cared about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book was also written to help children heal from their past hurts, to help them feel loved, and to give them inspiration, motivation, and a healthy outlook on life. They dont have to live in darkness; they can live with the light shining in their lives. They can be the light of the world and shine brightly like stars.&lt;br /&gt;
