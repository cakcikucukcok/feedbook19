      <meta name="description" content="Did you know that sperm determines gender? Each sperm carries either the male or the female producing chromosome. They differ from one another in big ways. Knowing how they differ, one can tilt the odds in favor of conceiving either a boy child or a girl child.  This is a 3 page report that includes a summary of the research, and step-by-step instructions for conceiving a boy or a girl. The method is all natural, there&#39;s nothing to buy besides an ovulation kit, and there&#39;s nothing invasive. It is also time tested. I originally did the research for my sister, and it worked for her. It also worked for 3 of my 4 friends who were starting their families.
