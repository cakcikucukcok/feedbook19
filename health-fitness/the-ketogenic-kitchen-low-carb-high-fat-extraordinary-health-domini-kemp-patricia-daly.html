  <title>The Ketogenic Kitchen: Low carb. High fat. Extraordinary health. - Domini Kemp, Patricia Daly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Cancer survivors Domini Kemp and Patricia Daly offer the first comprehensive ketogenic cookbook based on the most exciting new research on nutritional approaches to the prevention and management of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For decades, the ketogenic diet-which shifts the body&#39;s metabolism from burning glucose to burning fat, lowering blood sugar and insulin and resulting in a metabolic state known as ketosis-has been used to successfully manage pediatric epilepsy. More recently, it has been used by the Paleo community as a weight loss strategy. Now emerging research suggests that a ketogenic diet, in conjunction with conventional treatments, also offers new hope for those coping with cancer and other serious disease.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With endorsements from leading researchers and oncologists such as Dr. Thomas Seyfried (&lt;em&gt;Cancer as a Metabolic Disease&lt;/em&gt;), &lt;em&gt;The Ketogenic Kitchen&lt;/em&gt; offers more than 250 recipes, as well as meal plans and comprehensive scientific information about the benefits of a ketogenic diet, with sensible advice to help readers through periods of illness, recovery, and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This North American paperback edition has been updated to include U.S. customary units of measure appearing side-by-side with metric measures.&lt;/p&gt;" />
