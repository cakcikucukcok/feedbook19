      <meta name="description" content="God desires that you become outstanding in every endeavour of your life. His delight is for you to accomplish his plan and purpose for your life. He is excited to see you succeed in life.
By redemption the grace for you to succeed is already available to you. God has destined you for all round success in your business, career, finances, academics etc. Although you are destined to succeed, I would like you to know that there is no accidental success in life. Dr. Fred Price once remarked, we have not succeeded by accident. That means every success you see today is a product of conscious steps which were taken by the ones who desired it.
This book offers to you the fundamental steps that you must take for success to become a reality in your life. Success is a journey and I pray that you enjoy the ride. 
You will learn in this book that:-
	Success is a covenant
	Your mentality defines your success
	How to build  a positive attitude for success
	How to set smart goal and achieve them
	How to accept responsibility for Success" />
