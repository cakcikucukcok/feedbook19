  <title>How to Talk with Your Kids about Sex - Dr. John Chirban, Phil MCGRAW</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Equips parents to teach their children how to make sexuality a safe, healthy, and sacred part of their lives.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How parents address sex—their openness, the context, and their attitudes—will impact how their children view their own sexuality and self-worth. Dr. Chirban helps parents know when, how, and how much, and stresses the vital importance of their role in sex education. He uses humor, compassion, and real-life examples to prepare parents for healthy and ongoing conversations that equips their kids to own their own sexuality and provide an understanding of the larger issues of relationships, love, commitment, and intimacy. In addition, parents discover how helping their children grasp these veiled yet critical keys to a fulfilling life deepens their own connection with their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With specific helps for children from birth through young adult, Dr. Chirban provides context for what needs to be communicated at each stage of their development as well as tips for the inevitable surprise questions.&amp;nbsp;In addition, he tackles complicated issues such as pornography, relationships and the Internet, sexting, and homosexuality. Most important is the emphasis on strong family values and spirituality as it relates to sexuality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously released in 2007 as&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;What&#39;s Love Got to Do With It?&lt;/i&gt;, this revised book adds new insights from today&#39;s culture that make it even more relevant to parents and families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
