  <title>Finding Your Voice: A Woman&#39;s Guide to Using Self-Talk for Fulfilling Relationships, Work, and Life - Sandra Haber, Ellen McGrath, Alice Rubenstein, Lenore Walker...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;This unique and powerful book is a must-read for any woman on a path of self-discovery and personal empowerment. Authored by seven leading female psychologists, Finding Your Voice is full of inspiring wisdom and practical tools and will give the reader thousands of dollars worth of therapy for the price of one book!&quot;&lt;br&gt;-Barbara De Angelis, Ph.D.&lt;br&gt;author of Are You the One for Me?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recognize and realize your true desires&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is your life what you want it to be? For most women, the answer is not really. Too often, we listen to everyone but ourselves when it comes to determining how our lives should be proceeding-and this prevents us from living the lives we really desire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this remarkable new book, a team of highly credentialed psychologists shows you how to overcome unproductive, blameful thoughts and unrealistic expectations-the things you tell yourself about how marriages, friendships, children, and careers should be. Each chapter lays out widely promoted images of a modern woman-the mother raising a perfect child and loving every minute of it, the top-of-her-game career woman, the woman who loves her body just as it is-then reveals how women more often beat themselves up with these ideals than achieve them. Finding Your Voice shows you how to use self-talk to sort through expectations, isolate your own voice, and take the necessary steps to meet your unique needs. You&#39;ll be happier and more confident, and you will live a more fulfilled life-the one you&#39;re entitled to." />
