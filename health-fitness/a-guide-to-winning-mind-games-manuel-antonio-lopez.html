  <title>A Guide to Winning Mind Games - Manuel Antonio Lopez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There are many guides available that focus on dealing with stress, but virtually all the advice concentrates on responding to the results and symptoms of stress, rather than its causes. No wonder everyone continues to suffer from the devastating consequences of being stressed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author Manuel Antonio Lopez, a professional mechanical engineer, seeks to fill this void in knowledge by sharing stress alleviators that he has discovered over a lifetime. In this practical guidebook to understanding the causes of stress-related hair loss and illness, you can discover how to reverse harmful effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lopez looks back on his own battles with stress and how he went form being hyperactive and stressed out to relaxed and carefree. As a result of dealing with his stress, he went from being balding and overweight to being trim and sporting a head of thick, lustrous hair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get a better nights sleep, prevent depression, keep your hair, and, most importantly, boost your chances of living a long and healthy life with A Guide to Winning Mind Games.&lt;/p&gt;" />
