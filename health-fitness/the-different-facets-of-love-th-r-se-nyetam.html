  <title>The Different Facets of Love - Thérèse Nyetam</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Why speak about love in all its facets? Love is a diamondwe cannot fathom its depths. By a combination of all its facets, we hope to reach a vision of true love. I realize that all people are looking for love so they can say life is beautiful. Love appears in different forms, different versions, different ages, and different cultures. It is present everywhere, but transparent, like wind and water. Could it be an element of nature that feeds us daily? Everybody knows that when we fall in love, we just need fresh water to survive. Love is the word we use the most to express a feeling of satisfaction. We use it more to express our personal sensations than those inspired in somebody else. This is not our fault; we are taught growing up to hide our feelings and say things halfway, so as not to shock. Thats what it means to live in community.
	Society attempts to control people who have chosen to live inside itto control loveby imposing rules that restrict behavior. Sex is one of its priorities. In the olden days, homosexuality was a normal sexual behavior; it was tolerated. At the time of Kings, incest was accepted. Each period imposes sexual taboos, and as a consequence, nowadays we live with so many taboos we dont understand them in depth. To my mind, taboos are designed to manage the general interest and safeguard society. I also think that they have to arise themselves from a loving sentiment." />
