&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Reinvent yourselfCombine the time tested wisdom of sister sciences Yoga and Ayurveda to reinvigorate your metabolism, optimize your weight, awaken your energy and enliven your spirit.&lt;br /&gt;
Uncover your ideal blueprint. By changing your eating alone, you can change your life. Modern culture has lost touch with the way we were designed to eat. The result is weight gain, sluggish energy, and compromised health. The mind is clouded and the spirit is dull. When it comes to eating and food, the ancient knowledge and common sense behind Yoga and Ayurveda is needed now more than ever. Rediscovering this wisdom alone can transform the body, mind and spirit in just 40 days. &lt;br /&gt;
There will be no counting calories, fat, carbs, or points. This enlightened way of eating did not originate in Beverly Hills or South Beach, but from long ago and far away. These forty days arent only about losing weight but about gaining health, energy, and vitality. Many eating plans cause weight loss at the expense of energy and health. This plan is different. This plan is developed to lighten not only your body but the mind and spirit too. Optimal weight, health, energy, and vitality are the natural by-product of eating in the way we were designed to eat. Each day is a chapter in the book. Each chapter is one step forward on the journey to transformation. The next forty days will detoxify the system and reset your cravings, appetite, metabolism, and eating patterns. Forty days is the spiritually prescribed time period needed to reconstruct habits and forge lasting change. Watch your metabolism ignite, your moods lift, your energy surge, and your spirits soar. Your optimal self is there waiting for you at the end of the forty days!
