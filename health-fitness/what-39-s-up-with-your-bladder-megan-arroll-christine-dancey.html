  <title>What&#39;s Up With Your Bladder? - Megan Arroll, Christine Dancey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Is your personal, social or work life affected by problems with your bladder? Do you brush these problems aside, as just part of life and/or getting older? Have you talked to a health professional about these problems? Have you talked to &lt;i&gt;anyone&lt;/i&gt; about these problems? &lt;i&gt;What’s Up With Your Bladder?&lt;/i&gt; may be the place to start changing your approach to bladder health. As specialists in invisible illness – and as sufferers of several chronic illnesses – Dr Arroll and Professor Dancey bring together, with empathy and understanding, the latest research findings and clinical advice on bladder problems to show why it is unnecessary and so important NOT to suffer in silence. Diagnosis can lead to effective treatment and also be the basis for self-help strategies, all described within this book. Learn to recognise possible overactive bladder syndrome, cystitis and interstitial cystitis and (rarely) the warning signs of bladder cancer. Discover the behavioural techniques and lifestyle changes that can provide relief without the side effects of medication. Find comfort in knowing how many people share your problems and how many options are available for making things better. Taking control can start now!" />
