  <title>Motivated by Pain - Patrick Moore</title>

        He is naked in his bathroom. Fresh vomit stains his beard, hands, feet and legs. He cries uncontrollably - screaming, drunk as hell, with a good amount
        of Xanax, vodka, Soma and beer in his system, desperately wishing the pain would subside. He cant move. Its as if he is paralyzed. Perhaps he just
        wants to be gone? Not deadjust not living right now.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Its no secret that pain from a divorce can create intense feelings of shame and confusion. It can feel as though youre trapped, scared and alone. Too
        quickly in our relationships we run for the hills rather than sticking with our partner - till death truly do us part.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Motivated By Pain is a raw and emotionally-charged book in which Patrick Moore examines common personality differences between men and women, the
        raging battle of testosterone versus estrogen and the insurmountable damage stress can place on our relationships. Moores story will make you laugh,
        it will make you cry, but most of all it will make you think twice about the choices you are about to make...
    &lt;/p&gt;
