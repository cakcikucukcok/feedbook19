      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What is a goal? It&amp;#39;s been defined&amp;nbsp;in many ways, most of them so complex that things get fuzzy and complicated. Put simply, a goal is something you want to do. PUSH is designed to help readers think about things more simply. Identify your goals and put forth the simple, dedicated effort to achieve them. Having acheived one goal, it becomes easier to pursue others. We tend to make it complex. PUSH seeks to make it simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a matter of habit, we naturally&amp;nbsp;walk Life&amp;rsquo;s Proverbial Pathway&amp;nbsp;using one of two methods: react and respond to things that life throws our way or identify what we want our life to be and methodically pursue what we envision. One is defensive; the other purposeful. When in defense mode, we are caught up in everything that life throws our way. We fight to keep our head above water and steer our ship into the wind. Inside we know that, given the choice,&amp;nbsp;this isn&amp;rsquo;t the life we would choose. This, whatever form it may take from day to day, must be what life has chosen for us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the choice, we&amp;rsquo;d prefer to be on that identify and pursue path. That road seems smooth. That road sounds like it&amp;rsquo;s paved and well lit. That road is both challenging and exciting. That road has upside.&amp;nbsp;Given the choice&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;that&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em&gt; the choice we&amp;rsquo;d make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So...&amp;nbsp;why not make that choice?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PUSH is designed to help each reader find their own personal pathway of identity and, having found it, pursue their dreams in a simple, attainable fashion that leads to achievement. Broken into a handful of easy-to-read essays, PUSH mixes humor, common sense, and thought-provoking insight in an effort to give each reader the opportunity to see for themselves why they have absolutely no shot at ever being ordinary.&lt;/p&gt;" />
