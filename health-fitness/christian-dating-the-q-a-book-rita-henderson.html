  <title>Christian Dating: the Q &amp; a Book - Rita Henderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When you reached the proper dating age, did your parents discuss dating relationships with you, or like most of us, are you still trying to figure it out on your own? This is not surprising news. Research shows that most people date without a clue of what to do, or to expect in a relationship. However, I believe that Christian singles must understand how to navigate the dating waters. Christian Dating: The Q &amp; A Book shows how two people can cultivate a healthy and loving Christian bond, at any age. To help singles choose better-suited companions, the book includes a checklist of the most desirable traits of a Christian mate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christian Dating: The Q &amp; A Book explores a biblical view of dating. It inspires singles to consider whether current relationship attitudes and values are in line with godly principles. Accordingly, Christians are encouraged to evaluate their own thinking and actions. You will find straightforward, Scripture-based answers to 250 difficult relationship questions like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can I determine if my partner is relationship worthy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do I avoid rushing into love because I am lonely?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there ways to know if my partner loves me? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How should Christian women present themselves?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do I recover from heartbreak?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do Christian men love as deeply as Christian women?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do I move beyond the bad relationships?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are independent women problematic in Christian relationships?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What type of woman should a Christian man avoid?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does a Christian woman earn a Christian mans respect?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christian Dating: The Q &amp; A Book establishes a practical link between present day dating concerns and the timeless relevance of Gods Word. It validates that biblical Scripture is sufficient for teaching us to resolve our personal relationship challenges.&lt;/p&gt;" />
