  <title>Almost Della - Della Barbato</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Almost Della chronicles the true story of grooming, molestation and rape over a three-year period from the eyes of a fifteen-year-old girl, and how it affects her life for the next three decades.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;She tells no one about her abuse until she is 45. Her toxic shame molded her adult life by creating a recurring pattern of choosing abusive and unavailable men. Her emotional pain is manifested in severe anxiety attacks, depression, hives and suicidal thoughts. She learns to cope by abusing alcohol and drugs. Only through years of recovery and therapy is she able to release her inner child from her dungeon of condemnation and begin to cultivate a love for herself. Della&amp;rsquo;s hope is that her book encourages rape and incest victims to release their shame and become survivors. As a society, we must start talking about rape and incest. Almost half of girls are sexually abused at some point in their lives. There are pedophiles everywhere, and we must arm girls worldwide with the knowledge and awareness to say no and tell someone!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
