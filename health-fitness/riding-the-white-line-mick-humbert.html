  <title>Riding the White Line - Mick Humbert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We all ride the white line, whether on a bicycle or in daily life. To our left is the smooth pavement where traffic is heavy, speed is up, and people are in a hurry. To our right is the shoulder which, while safer and slower, is often littered with gravel, broken glass, and the occasional pothole. Most of us choose to ride a white line existence: in the flow of traffic but within easy reach of the cluttered shoulder. Along the way, we are affected by and also impact the pedestrians of life that we meet and interact with. 
With several long distance fund raising bicycle trips as a backdrop, Mick speaks to some of the positive values in life. Through the &quot;pedestrians&quot; he meets and the values they live out, Mick explores some of these values. Pedaling along the white line of life, while dangerous, is also rewarding. Certainly the pedestrians one meets are worth every revolution." />
