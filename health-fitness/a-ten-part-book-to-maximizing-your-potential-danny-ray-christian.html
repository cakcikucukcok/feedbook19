  <title>A Ten-Part Book to Maximizing Your Potential - Danny Ray Christian</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Two things you should know about this book are the fact that if you have ever wanted an answer to breaking out of your poverty, low self-esteem, or addiction, you will find it here. I have drawn on my experience of spending many years dealing with these issues for solutions as to how they can be successfully conquered. I am a living testimony that where the mind and spirit leads, the body will follow, and that we can always do better than we know.
Secondly, when I decided to publish this book, I made up my mind that I wasn&#39;t going to try and sell it to anyone who isn&#39;t tired of being &quot;sick and tired&quot; and who hasn&#39;t reached the point that they can&#39;t go on doing the same old thing, expecting different results. I know that when people get sick enough of meeting with failure and disappointment you won&#39;t have to go looking for them with a cure; they will come looking for you. I am convinced that as bad as things are for many of us that our suffering is working to drive us to God and the solutions He has enabled concerned people to develop. This book is for those who want to do something different than they have always done to get something different than they have always had. 
It may hurt the sale of this book, but I don&#39;t encourage you to buy it if you are not ready to do some serious work on the problem areas of your life and are tired of making excuses for your life not getting better if you are not doing anything to make it better. This book is not for your shelf; it is to be used in fixing anything broken in your life, mind, or spirit." />
