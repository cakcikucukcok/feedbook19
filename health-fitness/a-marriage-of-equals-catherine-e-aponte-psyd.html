  <title>A Marriage of Equals - Catherine E. Aponte PsyD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="• Sociologist Kathleen Gerson found in her study of 120 young women and men between 18-32 that most hoped to create lasting, egalitarian partnerships, but were doubtful about their chances of reaching this goal. (&lt;em&gt;The Unfinished Revolution: Coming of Age in a New Era of Gender, Work, and Family&lt;/em&gt;, Kathleen Gerson, PhD)
• In 1960, more than 70 percent of all adults were married, including nearly six in ten twentysomethings. Half a century later, in 2010, just 20 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds were hitched in 2010. Marriage was the norm for young America. Now it&#39;s the exception. (&lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;) 
• Self-help books represent a decent share of the bestsellers in bookstores, and sales have been on the rise. At the Washington, DC Public Library, for example, 11 of the top 50 titles with the highest circulation are “self-help.” (&lt;em&gt;Quartz News&lt;/em&gt;)
• In 2016, 94% of 18- to 33-year-olds had committed to making personal improvements, compared with 84% of baby boomers and 81% of gen Xers. (&lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;)
AUDIENCE:
• Millennials who are buying into the self-improvement ethos
• Couples in life transitions (from partners to parents, death of a loved one, a change in a job or financial situation, a move, an injury or illness)
• Couples seeking marital enrichment
• Couples experiencing marital difficulties
• Professional psychologists" />
