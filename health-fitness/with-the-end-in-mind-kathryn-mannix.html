  <title>With the End in Mind - Kathryn Mannix</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;For readers of Atul Gawande and Paul Kalanithi, a palliative care doctor&#39;s breathtaking stories from 30 years spent caring for the dying.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Modern medical technology is allowing us to live longer and fuller lives than ever before. And for the most part, that is good news. But with changes in the way we understand medicine come changes in the way we understand death. Once a familiar, peaceful, and gentle -- if sorrowful -- transition, death has come to be something from which we shield our eyes, as we prefer to fight desperately against it rather than accept its inevitability. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Dr. Kathryn Mannix has studied and practiced palliative care for thirty years. In  With the End in Mind , she shares beautifully crafted stories from a lifetime of caring for the dying, and makes a compelling case for the therapeutic power of approaching death not with trepidation, but with openness, clarity, and understanding.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Weaving the details of her own experiences as a caregiver through stories of her patients, their families, and their distinctive lives, Dr. Mannix reacquaints us with the universal, but deeply personal, process of dying. With insightful meditations on life, death, and the space between them, &lt;i&gt;With the End in Mind&lt;/i&gt; describes the possibility of meeting death gently, with forethought and preparation, and shows the unexpected beauty, dignity, and profound humanity of life coming to an end." />
