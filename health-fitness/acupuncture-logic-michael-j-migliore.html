  <title>Acupuncture Logic - Michael J. Migliore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;The information contained in this book, although familiar to many practitioners and students, is presented in a concise logistical format. This unique method of utilizing acupuncture treatment algorithms for differential diagnosis of disease states is logically systematic and useful both as an acupuncture treatment text and reference guide. The compilation of material is extracted from Chinese Acupuncture and Moxibustion, Foreign Language Press, Beijing. The disease states are listed alphabetically and are located at the top of the page. They are then subcategorized and differentiated according to their main manifestations. The acupuncture treatment points that are specific to the disease state are found next, followed by the tongue and pulse diagnosis. Located at the bottom of the page are acupuncture treatment points that are common to the various subdivisions of the disease states. It is often helpful to start at the bottom of the page, identifying common acupuncture treatment points to each subdivision (if there are any). This unique presentation of the material appears visually clear, uniform and easier to decipher and commit to memory. The appendix contains the disease states and acupuncture treatment points listed in a quick reference chart. This document will prove to be a valuable tool to both practitioner and student.&lt;br&gt;" />
