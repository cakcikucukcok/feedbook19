      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever been in a relationship that you knew was no good for you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had to make a decision that would ultimately change the course of your life?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you undo a decision?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Decision&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is the first in a three-part series of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Mental Gymnastics&lt;/em&gt; that tracks the stormy relationship between Melissa and Travis.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Melissa wakes up one morning, she knows her life will never be the same again. Today is that day that most women dream about, but not Melissa.

On the surface, things look rosy but on the inside, Travis&amp;rsquo;s continual mind-games and neglect of her basic needs are tearing Melissa apart. However, having put off the wedding for long enough, it is time for her to bite the bullet and walk down the aisle and face the decision she made to say &lt;em&gt;yes.&lt;/em&gt; Set over a four hour period, The Decision&amp;nbsp;invites you into Melissa&amp;rsquo;s mind as she reflects on the relationship and contemplates her decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will Melissa go ahead with a decision that will drastically alter the course of her life and wellbeing or will she choose to end the mental gymnastics?&lt;/p&gt;" />
