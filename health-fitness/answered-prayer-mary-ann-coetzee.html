  <title>Answered Prayer - Mary-Ann Coetzee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever wondered if God is real and does answer prayer. Among the pages of this book you will find different instances of Gods great mercy as He answers prayers. The author had an unexplained desire to write this book. She wanted to stay in Gods will for her life and she prayed the following prayer in private. Our Heavenly Father I dont understand why I have such a desire to write this book, but please confirm if it is your will for me to write this book in a way that I would be sure and may your will be done in each and every persons life that reads this book.
She prayed the prayer Thursday morning while driving to work. That Sunday while they were in church listening to the pastor while he was preaching up a storm something remarkable happened. The pastor raised his hand and pointed right at the author and said God said He will bless your book. His human element came in and he realized what he just said. He looked at the author and said and you are writing a book, arent you, she replied Yes I am and not even my husband knew about it.
This is a story of Gods gracious kindness. Through this book the message is conveyed that God is still a God who answers prayers no matter what circumstances you find yourself in and that there is no sin or circumstance that is beyond Gods grace. When we are at the end of our road God thrushes open a way for us.
God answering prayer changed the destiny of a young girl from despair to one filled with hope. The author was 24 years old when she was diagnosed with Systemic Lupus Erythmatosus (SLE). One of the prayers that were answered by God was to show her how to beat this incurable disease, which God did. Gods great wisdom is proclaimed when He showed the author the way how to beat a disease as fierce as Systemic Lupus Erythmatosus or more commonly known as Lupus.
This book contains Dr. Johanna Budwigs a German premier biochemist cure for cancer. The cure can also be used to prevent cancer from developing.
May this book be a blessing to you and may you find your miracle." />
