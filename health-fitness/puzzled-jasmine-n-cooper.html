  <title>Puzzled - Jasmine N Cooper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Nothing beats a failure but a try. Jasmine Cooper is proof of this example through the will of God. Many of us growing up, could only imagine having a life full of abundant success filled with everlasting friendships, joy and intimate relationships. When life doesn&amp;rsquo;t go according to our plan, we as individuals sometimes tend to lose ourselves; chasing what we want our reality to be. So, what does life look like for the girl who once had it all but lost herself in the pursuit of love?&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Within the pages of this autobiography, there are seasons of emotions, vulnerability, betrayal, embarrassment, deceit, loss of trust and broken promises, Jasmine walks us through her journey of what it was like to be broken and what it took to find the strength to change the outcome of her circumstances. Though it wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy, Jasmine found the self love that she needed to turn unforeseen life challenges into opportunities and motivation, which allowed her to grow through what she had experienced. Everyone in life has a story and is faced with challenges that can be difficult to overcome. But through telling her story, Jasmine hopes to encourage and uplift other Queens along the way, to love themselves more than they love the idea of &amp;ldquo;being in love.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Learning to love yourself again after feeling like you have consistently failed, is an everyday process and a daily commitment. One has to take certain steps to want to be better. Jasmine&amp;rsquo;s love for herself and new found definition of love through the birth of her daughter provided her with the tools to overcome self doubt, rejection and failure. As long as she maintained her unwavering faith, love and trust for God throughout her journey, she always knew that the day would come when she would be able to piece her life back together again.&lt;/p&gt;" />
