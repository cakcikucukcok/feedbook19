  <title>When The Way Is Unclear: Inspiration and Poetry to See You Through - Fawn Howard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We all have a different story. We all struggle day to day, trying to understand our purpose. Know that with God there is nothing that you can not do.  God never leaves us alone. But when the way becomes unclear. When you struggle to see the good in life. When you struggle to see your purpose. Remember that you are not alone.  There is a light at the end of your story.  Focus on that light.  Though the darkness may be all around you.  Focus on that light.  It will lead you through.  When the way is unclear.  Focus on God.  He is the Light. And He will guide your way." />
