      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The vibrant and beloved star of &lt;em&gt;Once and Again&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Sisters&lt;/em&gt; offers a story about her journey home to recapture the magic of youth in the deep South for her children and to make peace with the death of her mother.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;br /&gt;At a time when much of America is yearning to recapture the spirit and feelings of a more innocent era, comes the paperback edition of this exceptional book, from one of our most beloved actresses: a story of one woman&amp;#8217;s journey to reconnect with the landscape of her childhood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though best known today as the star of the television series Once &amp;#38; Again and Sisters, Sela Ward considers herself first and foremost a small-town girl. The eldest of four children, she was raised by a father who helped her believe in herself, and by a mother who taught her a sense of the importance of virtues like self-respect, grace, and sacrifice. In her hometown of Meridian, Mississippi, within a tightly-knit community of neighbors and kin, Sela learned ways that would remain with her throughout life&amp;#8212;humble virtues that were &amp;#8216;forged in the hearth of a loving home.&amp;#8217; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long after she had established herself as a successful model and Emmy Award winning actress, Sela started her own family, and found herself pining for the comforts of her small-town childhood. In an effort to balance her children&amp;#8217;s West Coast upbringing with a taste of a more natural way of life, she and her husband built a second home on a farm in Meridian, Mississippi so that her family could retreat there several times each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as Sela was reconnecting with the rhythms of home, though, her world was rocked by a crisis the family had long anticipated but never quite prepared for&amp;#8212;the death of her mother. As her family gathered around her mama&amp;#8217;s bedside, Sela&amp;#8217;s simple journey home became something far deeper: a turning point in her own life, as she pondered her mother&amp;#8217;s complicated legacy, and came to terms with just what it was she herself was searching for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filled with warmth, storytelling, and laughter, Homesick is a book to treasure: an exploration of the lessons we carry away with us from childhood, and a celebration of the bittersweet legacy of home. &amp;#160; &lt;/p&gt;" />
