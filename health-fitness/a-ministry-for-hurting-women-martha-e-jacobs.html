  <title>A Ministry for Hurting Women - Martha E. Jacobs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is an inspirational meditation for women of these times. All that they have been through and all that the multitudinous ones the Palmer, Locust, Cankerworm and Caterpillar have destroyed, the word of the Lord declared And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten.
				My sincere desire is that this book will bring comfort, joy, peace and the strengthening of the Spirit knowing that we as daughters of God, have not been forgotten. The Character of a new woman has emerged out of the dark tunnels that the manipulation of Evil Spirits meant for harm.
				This is a great work that God Almighty has given me to accomplish and I pray that His will, not my will, will be done. For it is He in whom we move, live and have our being. Having faith in God is to have wings to mount up like an eagle. There is a rainbow at the end of the tunnel. Be encouraged and the Lord will shift some things in your lives, a transition that will position you for greatness." />
