  <title>Daily Happy Living - Gopi Menon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Do you think that unhappiness is the unavoidable lot of human beings? 
Does happiness seem an unreachable goal for you?  
Not so says author Gopi Menon in his book &#39;Daily Happy Living&#39;!  He declares that you can be happy every day of your life by using the Joycentrix System described in this book.
The Joycentrix System is a new philosophy that makes it easier to find happiness in this world.  It outlines a simple natural way to make Happy Living a habit. You do not have to spend hours meditating, or carry out ritual worship in the hope of receiving happiness.  
Instead, youll learn a basic, easy-to-follow set of beliefs that make it easier to find happiness in your everyday life.  The ideas may seem controversial at first, but by following these simple, practical tips, you can make your life a happy one.
Author Gopi Menon believes that in order to achieve results, a philosophy must be practical.  His Joycentrix System is much more than simple dogma; its a practical philosophy that sets out the beliefs and practices he himself uses to achieve happy living here and now. By following his system, you can make happy living your new reality.
Some of the benefits you get from reading this book are:
	* You learn why it is pointless to &#39;pursue happiness&#39; as explained in Chapter 6.
	* How you too can overcome road rage (or uncontrollable anger) almost overnight as shown in Chapter 12.
	* You learn the difference between Pseudo-Happiness and Real Happiness or Joy in the Chapter entitled Misconceptions About Happiness.
	* Learn about &#39;daily miracles&#39; and gratitude in Chapter 8.
	* How a marriage headed for the rocks was saved by applying Happy Living Tips 4 &amp; 5.
	* How to feel upbeat and energized using Happy Living Tips 8, 9 &amp; 10.
	* And much much more 
Starting today, you can be happier! If you are looking for simple, practical tips that you can use today to make happy living a habit, then Gopi Menons Daily Happy Living can help." />
