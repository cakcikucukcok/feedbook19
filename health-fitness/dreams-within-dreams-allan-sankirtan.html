  <title>Dreams Within Dreams - Allan Sankirtan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If life is Dream within a Dream,
Who are we, that we dare to dream all this,
and share it willingly, with loving awareness,
with each other?
What if you met your counterparta future you, who could inspire you with visions of future possibilities? Or a past version of yourself, exploring their own lessons in another lifetime? How could you help yourself, or them, get the most from lifes shared experiences?
Step into the magical reality of Aidan and Effie, who meet in a beautiful garden within a dream. Lost in a floral maze, they agree to work together. They seek help from an old man named Hans and his partner, Una. But all is not as it seems and before they can leave the garden, they must confront themselves and their perception of reality.
Share the trepidation of their journey of discovery, as they confront the challenges and lessons of time travel. Stand in awe as they witness the birth of new universes and unravel the mysteries of life. Share their wonder as they re-examine their hopes, fears and dreams for the future, and the multidimensional nature of the symbols used by the soul to express its innate creativity.
Aidan and Effie realise they must take their new awareness back to their own reality, where they can focus their creative efforts to bring their dreams to fruition. They make arrangements to meet physically in time and space, where they can continue their experiences in the so-called world of flesh and blood. But which so-called reality will they choose to explore?" />
