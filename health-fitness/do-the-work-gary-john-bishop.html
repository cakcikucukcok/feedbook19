Through seven paradigm shifting assertions such as: &amp;#8220;I am wired to win,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;I embrace the uncertainty&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;I expect nothing and accept everything,&amp;#8221; Bishop helped millions of readers to move past their self-imposed limitations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Still, Bishop knows it&amp;#8217;s hard to go from reading the book, feeling inspired, and then actually doing the necessary work. That&amp;#8217;s where&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Do the Work&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;comes in: it&amp;#8217;s the kick in the ass you need to get moving and create the life you want. The workbook drills down into three categories &amp;#8212; self, people, and purpose &amp;#8212; to help you identify and remedy the challenges that frustrate and often cripple us. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filled with entirely new material, including personalized prompts and exercises with ample lined space to journal and process, &lt;em&gt;Do the Work&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;expands the lessons in&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Unfu*k Yourself&lt;/em&gt;, giving you the tools to intentionally commit to taking on your life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;This is a personal workshop for your brain, a legit resource where you can work your life out, what matters to you, what&amp;#8217;s going to make the biggest difference and empower you to act in ways that make some palpable change to the direction your life is currently taking.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth will set you free, right? So what are you waiting for?&lt;/p&gt;" />
