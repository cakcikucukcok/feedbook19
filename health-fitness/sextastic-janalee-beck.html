  <title>Sextastic! - Janalee Beck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sextastic! Improve your Love Life in Seven Weeks&lt;/i&gt; is for couples who want to rekindle, refresh, and reboot their relationship. Janalee Beck&#39;s mission is to step-up your intimate pillow talk and heighten your physical pleasure, which grows your capacity for connection. She also dispels myths and misconceptions about romantic love. In short, she brings couples closer together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a candid, easy-to-understand style, the author also:&lt;br&gt;
Helps couples talk about sex and their feelings
Explores ways to connect more passionately
Strengthens cross-gender communication skills
Boosts self-confidence in &amp; outside the bedroom
Helps readers overcome obstacles to oral sex
Clarifies how lovers self-sabotage pleasure
Offers 17 dynamic techniques for gratification
Includes interactive exercises to build strong ties
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By taking a few hours of your time in the next seven weeks, you&#39;ll discover greater love, sex, romance, and intimacy for a lifetime. What a great trade-off! Establish a supportive foundation for how to behave toward your partner in the future. As a couple, are you willing to open up emotionally, share feelings, and
explore new horizons?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be honest and kind when completing synergistic exercises. Take time to write
down your answers. What you believe about love and romance eventually becomes your reality. While there&#39;s no perfect formula to enhance intimacy, this workbook steers you in the right direction. Good luck, couples!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;
&quot;Janalee Beck captures the essence of sexual intimacy, bringing to the forefront the essential ingredients of passion and pleasure. She boldly shares her insights for our benefit. I highly recommend this book for anyone seeking to embrace a level of intimacy never before achieved, regardless of age.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
