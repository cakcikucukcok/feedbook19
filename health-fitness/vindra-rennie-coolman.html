  <title>Vindra - Rennie Coolman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The only gift we can give to the world is the manifestation of the Spirit in our every moment. We can be the Light that is needed in our country and our world today. Every one of us has the power to bring about change, if only we can believe and touch the Spirit within. 
For Vindra Naipaul-Coolman these words were reflected in the life that she lived. She was a modern day contemplative, born in Trinidad and Tobago, who believed that she could make a difference in its development at all levels. Her much publicised kidnapping and murder in December 2006 has left an indelible mark in the landscape of our country. 
This book introduces other aspects of her extraordinary life in the hope that her story will become more than just a passing memory. Ultimately, it should serve as a catalyst for change both in our inner and outer worlds." />
