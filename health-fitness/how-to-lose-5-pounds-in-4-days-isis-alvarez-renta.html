  <title>How to Lose 5 Pounds in 4 Days? - Isis Alvarez-Renta</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When we start a diet, we look for a permanent change in our lives and the changes that become permanent are those that are in the here and now.
The here and now is a concept widely used by well-respected institutions that engage in change of behavior, and allow us to make a commitment to change in the present, for the benefit of a future.
Deciding to start a diet is the most important factor for success, as the diet becomes a tool to achieve what we intend to.
This decision should be based on a desire to care for our physical and mental health and not just on aesthetics grounds.
Fortunately, dieting is up to us unlike many other situations that are beyond our control. To start and continue a successful diet must seize this magic moment when we realize we have a few extra pounds and make the decision to lose them.
A diet to reduce weight begins now and only for today, and it is extremely important to keep in mind what is our ultimate goal, and divide the process into several small goals that will bring us closer to it, whose compliance is easy to us and help us cope with the diet with ease.
It is useless to start the diet tomorrow or Monday that gives us permission to eat all we want until then that will result in gaining weight before we even start.
In general terms, those who are not overweight, eat what they want in normal quantities, when they are hungry, satisfy the need for food, and know they can eat when they are hungry again.
We must learn to distinguish physical hunger from the desire to eat and in many cases, this is due to a medical condition known as anxiety corresponding to different causes; these are related to an emotional vacuum, which has nothing to do with the physical food.
In this book, we refer to hunger from a physiological point of view as opposed to an excess of appetite caused by anxiety.
I suggest that like any other business that means to change our lives, it is important to use common sense and go to a specialist physician before starting this or any other diet; also, eat the recommended servings in the recipes, which I provide for the preparation of meals, eliminating the risk of including an ingredient that prevents us from losing weight.
I want to emphasize the need to include physical activity that constitutes an effective and enjoyable way to burn calories: exercise, take dance classes, walking, etc. 
These raise the levels of endorphins helping to make easier the removal of excess body weight.
Endorphins give us a natural excitement that makes us feel good about ourselves and thus motivates us to comply with diet and exercise programs.
