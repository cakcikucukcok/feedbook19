  <title>Lucy’S Biggest Fish to Fry - Tom Stockburger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;It was January of 2009 when Tom Stockburger first noticed his wife, Lucy, acting strangely. He attributed it to exhaustion and sent Lucy to take a nap, with no idea that just a few hours later she would suffer a seizure that eventually led to the life-changing diagnosis of  brain cancer. Without warning, Tom and Lucy were propelled on a thirty-two-month journey that would test their inner strength, faith, and courage in more ways than they ever imagined.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In his poignant memoir, Tom shares a heartfelt, informative glimpse into Lucys brave battle with cancer, one that included brain surgeries, multiple chemotherapy and radiation treatments, and consultations with some of the leading brain cancer specialists in the world. Meanwhile, Tom slowly adjusted to his new role as Lucys caregiver and chief communicator for family and friends.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Tom details Lucys resolve to fi ght the cancereven with a less-than-ideal prognosisand her determination to keep him focused on the important things in life. Lucys Biggest Fish to Fry off ers a moving tribute to a strong and courageous spirit, a loving marriage, and one familys determination to heal after an unfathomable loss.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This is worth the read to see how value, quality, and love can make the final chapters as good or better than any other chapter.&lt;/P&gt;
