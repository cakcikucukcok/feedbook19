  <title>“Edward’S Humor” and More - Edward R. Levenson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Edwards Humor and More: Humor, Word Play, Personae, Memoirs, and Interpretation contains writings in the five different categories. Each one contains respective elements of the other four. Edward, the main persona of Edward in his nuclear family when he was growing up, gained no fewer than seventeen additional personae in the course of the enrichment of his life. The pieces in Word Play range from the flippant, to the semiserious, to the intellectual. Interpretation has two parts: insights about material from twenty-five Sabbath portions of the week in the five books of Moses and an innovative approach to the relationships of the members of the Hebrew first family. Interpretation extends to the essay in his Memoirs section Three Jewish Women in This Bridge Called My Back. The book has something for everyonefrom grades nine to twelve to adults." />
