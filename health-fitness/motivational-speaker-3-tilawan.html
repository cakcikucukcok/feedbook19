  <title>Motivational Speaker 3 - Tilawan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There are some things when we miss them in life, it won&#39;t matter
what else we gained. There are some things when we gain them, it won&#39;t
matter what else we missed and no greater wisdom can we discover than
this, and the greatest wisdom is to discover our purpose in life!
The day you discover God&#39;s purpose for your life, you will cease to
be using your your efforts but His. You will no longer use your strength but
His. You will no longer be using your wisdom in what you are doing but His.
You will no longer use your approach to issues of your life but His, for you
have discovered His assignment for your life! Your assigmnent in life is
never far from you, but it could be far from your focus. Always change your
focus to discover what is God&#39;s purpose for your life!
Wealth is not your purpose, it is a slice of it. Fame is not your
purpose, it is a slice of it. Power is not your purpose, it is a slice of it and until
you discover your purpose, the slices will keep distracting you from God&#39;s
plan for your life! Let no attraction; either the attractions of money, fame or
power distract you from pursuing your purpose in life! The attractions that
cannot distract you at the early stage of your struggles in discovering your
purpose in life, will serve you at its later stage!
Trying to do like everybody else might not be your purpose.
Trying to do what people like may not be your purpose. Trying to
do as you are told may not be your purpose. Trying to to impress
the people around you, may not be your purpose.
Discovering your purpose in life will give you a picture of where your
tomorrow will be. It will give you the right mentality to achieving a
breakthrough in life. Because whenever the journey of your struggles starts
to bog down, you cannot breakthrough with the wrong mentality that sees
you from a picture of where you found yourself. You can only go forward
with a right mentality of the picture of where your tomorrow will be.
And when tomorrow comes and you see yourself in great victory,
you will then realise that what is needed is not to thank God for answered
prayers but to apologise to Him for the times we go about in behaviours that
shows He was not faithful to us! A feeling in actions and activities that
shows He might not really have cared about our situation!
I came to the point that I planned to stop the show for the day.
My dear listeners, always have a positive attitude to whatever you
are going through in life and keep to the path and action that will carry you
to your victory in life. You can&#39;t get an answer by following a formula half
way. You can&#39;t get an answer by following a formula the wrong way. The
formula ensures that we do away with anything that is stopping us from
achieving our victory in life. Most times, it is the presence of some little
things that is denying the coming of some wonderful things in our
lives...
