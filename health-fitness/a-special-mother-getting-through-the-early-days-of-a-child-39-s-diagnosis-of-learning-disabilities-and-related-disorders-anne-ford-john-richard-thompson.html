      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;All mothers experience worries and fears about their children, but none can compare with the early days when a mother feels something&#39;s not quite right. Anne Ford knows the feeling. She&#39;s had it herself, having raised a daughter with severe learning disabilities, and has gone on to share experiences with others during her many years as a volunteer with the National Center for Learning Disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To bring comfort, support, and hard information to mothers-and fathers, too-in the early period surrounding the diagnosis, here is the book that Anne wishes she&#39;d had years ago when she first received the news about her daughter and didn&#39;t know where to turn for the practical and emotional help she desperately needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filled with essential advice and the voices of other mothers whose children have LD and related disorders such as Asperger&#39;s and ADHD, A Special Mother lets parents know they are not alone and that they can help their child to thrive. This invaluable book addresses such matters as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding Learning Disabilities and Related Disorders&lt;br /&gt;What Should You Do First?&lt;br /&gt;Interpreting Evaluation Results&lt;br /&gt;Resolving Disputes&lt;br /&gt;Special Fathers: They Are Out There&lt;br /&gt;The Social Side of LD&lt;br /&gt;Advocacy vs. Obsession&lt;br /&gt;How Are You Doing?: Taking Care of Yourself&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
