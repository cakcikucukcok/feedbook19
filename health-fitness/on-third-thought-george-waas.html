  <title>On Third Thought.... - George Waas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 2012, I wrote a memoir entitled &quot;Retired . . . and Loving It!!&quot; At that time, I covered every subject I wanted to write about, or so I thought. Then after publication, I began having second thoughts. Wait, that&#39;s not right. I had a second thought and decided not to write anything further. Then I had a third thought. I understand lots of people claim to have second thoughts about a particular matter, but if they have more than one, how can the one after the second also be a second thought? 
Frankly, I don&#39;t know how anyone can have second thoughts about the same subject. Anything beyond a second thought is a third, fourth, fifth, etc., at least by my count. It was on my third thought that, since I discovered other things to write about, I decided to set them out in a mini memoir as a sequel to my earlier book. I checked with an online publishing company and found several books entitled &quot;On Second Thought&quot; and &quot;On Second Thoughts&quot; and related titles. For those who chose the latter title, they probably didn&#39;t give it much thought. But I did, and I didn&#39;t find a single book that bore the title &quot;On Third Thought.&quot; So that&#39;s the one I chose; as they say, the third time is the charm. 
This sequel to my 2012 bookmy mini memoirfocuses on three general subjects. First, my reflections on things past; second, living in the present, since it&#39;s the only time we can live (the past is history and the future lies ahead); and third, making sure that, to the best of my ability, my future is bright and enjoyable by remaining involved in matters of interest and importance to me. 
And if I can write a book about me, you can write one about you. So get on with it." />
