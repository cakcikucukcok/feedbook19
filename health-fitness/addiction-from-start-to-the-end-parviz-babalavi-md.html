  <title>Addiction from Start to the End - Parviz-Babalavi Md</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The war against drugs is intensifying more and more everyday. Drug pushers have captured their young, penetrating all levels of their lives and affecting all the social, political, ethical, and economical well-being of the people around them. A physician with more than twenty-five years of experience in addiction medicine, Dr. Parviz-Babalavi brings valiantly attempts to open your eyes to this reality. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In Addiction from Start to the End, he presents the documents he has gathered through interviewing thousands of drug Substance Abuse Dependents and collecting valuable information from real human sources. His studies have led him to strongly theorize that it is the drug pushers, who are often unscrupulously well-protected, that should be condemned and eliminated. Profoundly, he discusses how America and other countries should pay more attention to fighting against the breeding of drug pushers happening even within seemingly safe communities. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Backed with in-depth study and research, Addiction from Start to the End daringly exposes the possible lapses that may have triggered the growing issue of drugs. It is aimed to become a wake-up call to every individual who is directly or indirectly affected by an illness undeniably happening in every corner of the world." />
