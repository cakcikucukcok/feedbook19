  <title>Reiki Energetics - John Kroneck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div id=&quot;00N40000001lfG7_ileinner&quot;&gt;Not only a Reiki manual, Reiki Energetics includes principles, tools, and insights regarding a model of energetic healing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reiki, translating to higher life energy, is a beautiful high frequency of natural energy that an individual may learn to use to facilitate his or her self-healing and personal growth. We may also use this elegant energy with others to assist with their health and wellness. The Reiki energy is simple to administer yet can have profound influences on ones health status. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book pulls together dynamics of energy systems, psychology, conscious awareness, and personal growth, creating a powerful and unique holistic approach to self-healing and wellness. In addition to self-healing tools, people taking classes with author John Kroneck learn how to work with clients to empower the clients to work with their own healing processes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further, considering healing approaches used under the names of energy psychology and energy medicine, it is clear that energy healing can be used effectively with other healing modalities. Inclusive of Reiki Energetics, however, is the recognition that energy healing or healing energetics is its own field with specific skill sets and healing processes. This is a new approach to health care that acknowledges and empowers our role in our health-care experiences. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The study of Reiki is a cornerstone in evolving this new field of healing energetics. Again, the Reiki approach is simple to administer. Yet, as with any work of significant spiritual significance, its depth and breadth of possibilities are without measure.&lt;/div&gt;" />
