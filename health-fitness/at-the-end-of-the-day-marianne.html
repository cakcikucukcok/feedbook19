&lt;P&gt;Patrick Myers was her first real boyfriend,they were married within a year of meeting, it seemed like a marriage made in heaven ,but B was yet to discover Patrick&#39;s dark side,a side that would turn her life and the life of her twelve children into a hell on earth.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;Mary, one of B&#39;s eight daughter&#39;s met and fell in love with Barry Kelly,a handsome seventeen year old, one month after he fifteenth birthday, the year was 1958. She wasn&#39;t to know back then the long road she was about to travel,would be paved with many a cross to lie heavily on her young shoulder&#39;s.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;For thirty five years she will walk the same path as B {her mother} toward a loveless marriage,scourged with alcoholism,gambling,violence and poverty.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Mary remained in her marriage out of loyalty to her young husband,aware that the real Barry was trapped inside the monster he had become. &lt;/P&gt;" />
