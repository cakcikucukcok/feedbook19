  <title>Breaking the Food Seduction - Neal M.D. Barnard, Joanne Stepaniak</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jennifer is a thirty-four-year-old bank manager. She&#39;s managed her education, her career, her finances--and her customers&#39; money--she can&#39;t seem to handle this darn little chocolate in a shiny wrapper. . . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you&#39;re drawn to chocolate, cookies, potato chips, cheese, or burgers and fries, we all have foods we can&#39;t seem to resist--foods that sabotage our best efforts to lose weight and improve our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These foods are winning the battle--but that&#39;s because we&#39;re fighting it in the wrong place. As physician and leading health researcher Dr. Neal Barnard explains in this groundbreaking book, banishing these cravings is not a question of willpower or psychology--it&#39;s a question of biochemistry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the author&#39;s research and that of other leading investigators at major universities, &lt;i&gt;Breaking the Food Seduction&lt;/i&gt; reveals the diet and lifestyle changes that can break these stubborn craving cycles. Using everyday examples, questionnaires, and practical tips, the book delivers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Fascinating new insights into the chemical reasons behind your cravings&lt;br&gt;- Seven simple steps to break craving cycles and tame your appetite&lt;br&gt;- Important advice for kids&#39; sugar cravings and how to halt them&lt;br&gt;- A three-week kick-start program &lt;br&gt;- One hundred delicious, satisfying recipes that help your body break the spell of problem foods and put you on   the path to weight loss, better health, and greater well-being&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This accessible and practical book is essential reading for anyone who wants to lose weight, lower cholesterol, feel more energetic, and get control of their health once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;" />
