  <title>Reaching Back to Touch My Soul - Linda DePass-Creque</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; In, &lt;b&gt;Reaching Back to Touch My Soul: Thoughts on Love, Laughter and Living&lt;/b&gt;, everyone has a chance to read about the parts of life that matter most: love, laughter, and living a meaningful life. In today&#39;s world, which is filled with so much nonessential data that clings to our mind like tissue paper to a shoe. Reaching Back to Touch My Soul gives us a chance to reconnect not only to each other but also to the often forgotten parts of ourselves.
The stories and essays in the book came into the world as op-ed pieces for The Virgin Islands Daily News. From different times, places and themes they have emerged as a family of ideas and grown as one.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are three major themes in the book. The first is Love, the second, Laughter, and the last Living
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Choosing Love as the starting point was easy, according to author Linda DePass-Creque, &quot;Love breathes life into everything else. It is from love that everything else flows&quot; The theme Laughter is a potpourri of topics and commentary written to make you smile as you take in its message. The last theme in this delightful book, Living, explores many of life&#39;s &quot;basic skills&quot;, including coping, understanding, tolerance, friendship and sometimes making sense out of nonsense!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With the wonderful illustrations of each theme , its humor, and its wise, down- to- earth philosophy, this book is well worth reading.
