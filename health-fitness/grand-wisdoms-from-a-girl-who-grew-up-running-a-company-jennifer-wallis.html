      <meta name="description" content="&lt;B&gt;Theres Nothing Worse&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;Than Being A Bad Parent&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;P&gt; Except FOR being a bad parent to an entrepreneurial CHILD
The fi rst thing you need to do is become aware of what really works and what
doesnt if you are one of those parents whos not sure how to nurture their childs
natural genius, but do know that the skillful parenting of your unique, highly
energized, and colorful biz-kid will be well worth the rewards.
BizBees philosophy is simple: that the craziness of the BizBees world be (1) the
perfect place where parents can learn how to effectively cope with their childs
tenacious spirit and (2) be a haven for the enterprising youth, where they can fi nd
friendships with people who think like they do, learn how to build a successful
business from scratch, and even start some joint venture partnerships with other
colorful kids who also have a deeply entrenched entrepreneurial spirit. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; This is a marvelous, inspiring book of humorous short stories and perceptive
suggestions by a girl whos been creating business ventures since she was 8
years old. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; We guarantee that through the amusing hoopla of the girl and her friends youll
discover ways to fi ne-tune your childs genius and long before youre able to put this
book down, youll be teaching your biz-kids about the coolness of taking charge of
their very own happiness. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; Do you have a entrepreneurial child? Use the checklist at the beginning of this
book to fi nd out." />
