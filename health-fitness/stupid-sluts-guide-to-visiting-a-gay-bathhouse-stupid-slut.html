With the thrill of anonymous sex mixed with the comforts of not giving a fuck, a gay bathhouse is the ultimate place where a man can sate his wildest sexual desires. While this is a godsend for the uninhibited, the fear of the unknown can often paralyze the mildly curious in not stepping through the door, particularly if his doubts are based in debauched storytelling and hearsay.&lt;br /&gt;
The Stupid Slut Series removes those barriers by using real people who have been there and done that to help those interested in navigating certain sexual terrain into venturing further or not.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; * * * *&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My heart starts to pound through my chest as my eyes starts to water while scanning over the prices on the letter board. Before, it was just butterflies in my stomach. Right now, I&amp;rsquo;m scared shitless. After more than a year to get here, to get up to this counter on this very night, I am just more than a little peeved at the packed parking lot out there. I swore late Sunday night for a sleepy little town like this spelled &amp;lsquo;deserted place&amp;rsquo; with everybody having to head off to work first thing in the morning. What if I see someone I know? What if&amp;hellip;? I took a deep breath to calm my nerves. So what? I&amp;rsquo;m a twenty-nine year old man paying my own way in this world.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After sliding the money through the cutout with just enough to cover the day-pass to get in and splurging heavily on the cheapest rental they offered the cashier points to the door and starts to rattle off a set of instructions. My head starts to spin just like it did the first time my best friend&amp;rsquo;s uncle convince my &amp;ldquo;faggot ass&amp;rdquo; to go down on him behind that tree at the lake on our camping trip. All the same, I&amp;rsquo;m able to get in through the set of locked heavy doors and make my way towards the stacks of lockers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Feeling like I could not breathe for so long, I finally catch my breath inside wrapping the towel around my bare waist. I feel surprisingly at ease like this, shirtless with the flat of my cock head chafing against this rough cloth. Nothing to be ashamed of, I sigh. Not that I have anything to be ashamed of, trading in my childhood pudginess for a much manlier frame, as it is winter here and it is bone-chilling cold outside. Here, it is quite warm and humid to where the Word of the Day flashed in my head like an alarm: sultry. The bathhouse is sultry. Mentally, this should have been a naturally given being it is a bathhouse and with it comes the insinuation of hot and steamy. This is my first visit here. Some things just have to be experienced first in order to take them in.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I am eager to explore, but I am unnerved by this frightening fear once again. The lockers and the nearby lobby are well lit. The rest, away from the door I just come through, seems to go dark at the entrance of the hallway, like some sort of horror film tunnel. Except there appear to a few of them heading off to a few adventures." />
