  <title>A Row a Day for a Year - D.P. Ordway</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Experts agree that if you set a goal and track your progress, youll succeed where others fail. Regular, moderate exercise is generally recognized as the closest thing to a fountain of youth, and &lt;i&gt;A Row a Day for a Year&lt;/i&gt;, by author D.P. Ordway, supports your ability to enhance your energy, fitness, and health by rowing each day for a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A month-by-month exercise journal, each month begins with quotations from the medical community and sages alike reminding you that regular, moderate exercise is essential and beneficial. A short article before your entries discusses rowing, training, and the rowing community. Ordway encourages you to take the challenge and row each day for a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;A Row a Day for a Year&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Row a Day for a Year&lt;/i&gt; should be handed to every person who wants to fall in love with indoor rowing. It is passion and knowledge at its best. This  is another great book and a great tool for indoor rowing people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Santiago Fuentes&lt;/b&gt;, Referee, 2012 London Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  Moderate exercise keeps us healthy and helps us age well.  Dusty lays out a journal approach to capture daily entries, combined with advice on training programs, cross-training and stretching. The quotes scattered through the book  are entertaining, inspiring, and full of common sense. A wonderful recipe for living better and rowing daily.&lt;/p&gt;
