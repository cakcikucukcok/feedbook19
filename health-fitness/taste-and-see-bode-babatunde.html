      <meta name="description" content="The book Taste and See: 40 Praise Principles for successful Living touches on the nitty-gritty of thanking, praising and worshipping God as a prelude to living a life of extraordinary good success. It postulates that praising God with zeal and enthusiasm makes Him to open His door of grace unto us. The book also enjoins us to praise God continuously, continuingly and continually. It advocates for the true praise of God which comes naturally and effortlessly and draws us to the presence of God. It states that, for the praise of God to be acceptable, it must be relaxed and unpretentious. 
It also identifies a true worshipper as someone who worships God when it is convenient or inconvenient, easy or difficult, good or bad.
This eight-chapter book is down to earth practical. It has 4o praise principles which instruct the reader on how he can embark on the praise and worship that will be acceptable to the Almighty God. There are also practical aphorisms that are spread all over the pages of the book from the beginning to he end. At the end of each chapter are also practical exercises which are designed to draw the reader more closely to God as well as build up a lasting relationship with Him." />
