  <title>The Anxiety-Elimination System - Nick Nicolaou</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Nick Nicolaou suffered his first major panic attack, he was told by the doctors that he will need medication to correct this and that there is not much else he can do about the problem and sent him home to get some sleep - and everything would be fine. 
But the next morning, he had another panic attack, and he knew he was in serious trouble as he could not control or stop the panic attack. From that point on, he developed generalised anxiety and phobias and he was having panic attacks every day. His friends thought he was going crazy.
It took a lot of work, but after years of research, he discovered how to fully recover from his anxiety and now he helps others to recover from their anxiety disorders too. When he faced probably his most stressful event of his life which was his divorce, not for one moment did inappropriate anxiety ever find its way back. 
In this self-help guide, he shares his anxiety-elimination system, which can also be used to cope with and overcome depression. 
Filled with the latest neuroscience research highlighting the real causes of anxiety, phobias, and depression, he provides guidance that you can use to take charge of your life, overcome past traumas, and approach each day with a positive attitude. 
As an ex sufferer he knows exactly what it feels like to have anxiety and he knows exactly what to do to reverse it, its one thing learning about anxiety disorders but its quite another living with it and beating it.
Overcome intrusive and anxious thoughts, panic and fear and escape the troubles that are chasing you down with The Anxiety-Elimination System." />
