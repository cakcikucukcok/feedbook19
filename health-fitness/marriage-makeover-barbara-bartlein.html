  <title>Marriage Makeover - Barbara Bartlein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;Trying to put the spark back in your most important relationship? Bartlein offers practical tips and insights into building a stronger relationship through everyday acts of love and kindness. Couples often wonder how they can improve their marriages and may invest considerable time and effort in classes, counseling, and encounter&quot;&quot; weekends to find the answers. More often, though, they do nothing. They settle into a daily routine that is busy and demanding with little time to think about, let alone implement, improvements to their marriage. Couples report, &quot;&quot;We simply grew apart,&quot;&quot; or &quot;&quot;We no longer enjoy the same things,&quot;&quot; or &quot;&quot;We just did not have time for each other.&quot;&quot; They drift through their busy lives, putting marriage on the back burner. They are then surprised when it fizzles out. This is unfortunate, because, as Bartlein reveals, with just a little effort, you can create experiences that weave together to strengthen, enhance, and grow your marriage, almost effortlessly.&lt;/DIV&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/div&gt;" />
