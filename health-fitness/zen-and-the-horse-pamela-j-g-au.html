  <title>Zen and the Horse - Pamela J.G. Au</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;This is a very interesting and intelligent little book; the author takes a unique approach to teaching centered, balanced riding, using Eastern philosophy as a context for mastering the art of equitation.  The author writes with credible authority and conveys ideas and concepts clearly and vividly.  Most important, the book delivers what it promises. It does provide specific advice for equestrians hoping to achieve this zen state in their riding.&quot; &lt;p&gt; 
As reviewed by Writers Digest, 2004&lt;p&gt;
&quot;I think this is the first writing that actually describes what I feel when I ride my horses. I have never wanted to compete, just reach that place of unity which will be an ongoing practice with the horse for the rest of my life. No hurry to get somewhere, only connect while there! Maybe someday you will put this great book into visual movement in a video? You have really taken the mechanics out and replaced with emotion, awareness, with motivation to feel!!! With great respect to our patient teacher, the horse. &quot; Sincerely, Chris in OR. 
&quot;A must for the serious rider. This book stayed on target and was easy to keep up with. Most Zen horse books make me want to gag after 5 minutes, but this author has both of her feet on the ground and a lot to say. Buy it! you and your horse will both benefit.&quot; Chuck
