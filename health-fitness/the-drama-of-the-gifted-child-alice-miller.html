  <title>The Drama of the Gifted Child - Alice Miller</title>

I simply meant all of us who have survived an abusive childhood thanks to an ability to adapt even to unspeakable cruelty by becoming numb.... Without this &#39;gift&#39; offered us by nature, we would not have survived.&quot; But merely surviving is not enough. &lt;i&gt;The Drama of the Gifted Child&lt;/i&gt; helps us to reclaim our life by discovering our own crucial needs and our own truth.&lt;/div&gt;" />
