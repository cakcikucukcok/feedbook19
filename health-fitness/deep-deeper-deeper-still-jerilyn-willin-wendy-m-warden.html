  <title>Deep, Deeper, Deeper Still - Jerilyn Willin, Wendy M. Warden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is often something deep in our life that leads us to pen and page and the age-old practice of
collecting our thoughts on paper.
This for many is the fi rst adventure with journaling. Sinking our toes deep
into the benefi ts of collecting our thoughts can easily become journaling.
Harvesting the wealth of knowledge generated from the collecting of our thoughts and putting
this knowledge into action in our lives is the act of going deeper.
It is when we grace pen to page on a regular basis that we are actually journaling and going
deeper still. Journaling is a practice that allows us the ability to go beyond collecting our
thoughts, to harvesting knowledge and understanding our internal process and motivations.
Journaling also helps generate useful insights about those with whom we share our life journey.
When our thoughts are collected our lives are calmer, we have more clarity about life choices
and achieve life success both small and large with greater ease. Our roots, so to speak, are
planted deep in ground beneath our feet. When we have access to the wealth of our own
knowledge and put that wealth to use, our lives tend to be more fl uid our roots have worked
their way deeper into solid ground. When our roots are sunk into terra fi rma we are deeper
still or deeply still, understanding our thoughts and feelings, our actions and choices, and how
we create our lives." />
