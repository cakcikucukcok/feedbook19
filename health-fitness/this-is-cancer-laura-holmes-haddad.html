  <title>This is Cancer - Laura Holmes Haddad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Cancer is indiscriminate. It cares little for class, creed or color. Its  patients are literally everywhere. When Laura Holmes Haddad was  diagnosed, she discovered shelf upon shelf of overly-earnest, somber,  gray survival books, and knew there had to be a better way. &lt;i&gt;This Is Cancer&lt;/i&gt;  is the thoughtful, informative fabulous-looking result for those who  prefer their pathos with equal parts humor and reality and a touch of  flair. A &quot;what to expect when you&#39;re expecting&quot; book for the diagnosis  you don&#39;t want but are stuck with, &lt;i&gt;This Is Cancer&lt;/i&gt; is the book  that patients keep in their &quot;heading to the hospital bag,&quot; because it&#39;s  the only one that tells them what&#39;s going on &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; keeps them company.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Including such useful snippets as:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is no limit to what you will put yourself through when told it might save your life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay away from the Internet. And don&#39;t let anyone tell you &quot;what they looked up&quot; about your diagnosis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You&#39;ll be surrounded by people but you&#39;ll feel lonely, and alone, sometimes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lexapro is Tylenol for the soul.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you don&#39;t like your doctor(s), find new ones. You will feel somewhat  at the mercy of them, like they hold the key to your mortality, but in  fact more than one doctor can potentially save you and some are nice and  some are mean.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whether you or your loved ones want a primer full  of useful information in an easy to reference format or a friendly and  comforting read, the honest, grave, and mordantly funny stories and tips  from young survivors will bring you the real intel and advice that you  need most during this tremendously difficult time." />
