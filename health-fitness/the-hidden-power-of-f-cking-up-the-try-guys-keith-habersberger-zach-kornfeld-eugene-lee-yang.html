  <title>The Hidden Power of F*cking Up - The Try Guys, Keith Habersberger, Zach Kornfeld, Eugene Lee Yang...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Try Guys deliver their first book&amp;#8212;an inspirational self-improvement guide that teaches you that the path to success is littered with humiliating detours, embarrassing mistakes, and unexpected failures.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be our best selves, we must become secure in our insecurities. In &lt;em&gt;The Hidden Power of F*cking Up, &lt;/em&gt;The Try Guys - Keith, Ned, Zach, and Eugene - reveal their philosophy of &lt;em&gt;trying:&lt;/em&gt; how to fully embrace fear, foolishness, and embarrassment in an effort to understand how we all get paralyzed by a fear of failure. They&amp;#8217;ll share how four shy, nerdy kids have dealt with their most poignant life struggles by attacking them head-on and reveal their - ahem - sure-fail strategies for achieving success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they&amp;#8217;re not just here to talk; they&amp;#8217;re actually going to put their advice to work. To demonstrate their unique self-improvement formula, they&amp;#8217;ll each personally confront their deepest insecurities. A die-hard meat-lover goes vegan for the first time. A straight-laced father transforms into a fashionista. A perpetually single sidekick becomes the romantic lead. A child of divorce finally grows more intimate with his family. Through their insightful, emotional journeys and surprising, hilarious anecdotes, they&amp;#8217;ll help you overcome your own self-doubt to become the best, most f*cked up version of yourself you can be!&lt;/p&gt;" />
