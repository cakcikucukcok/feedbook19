    PLAYING DETECTIVE
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    A Self-Improvement Approach
    &lt;br/&gt;
    to Becoming
    &lt;br/&gt;
    a More Mindful
    &lt;br/&gt;
    Thinker, Reader, and Writer
    &lt;br/&gt;
    By Solving Mysteries
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    By Robert Eidelberg
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The intentionally long subtitle to PLAYING DETECTIVE comes close to saying it all about this unique two-in-one book  but not quite. PLAYING DETECTIVE is
    both a book to read for the fun of it and a book to read for self-improvement if you are looking to become a better thinker, reader, and writer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The for-the-fun-of-it part comes from reading and wondering about the mystery-solving approaches and skills of the contemporary and classic detectives
    showcased in these 17 remarkable mystery stories. The self-improvement part comes from the books four special interactive features: Suspicions?, How
    Clever?, DetectWrite, and Dont Peek!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Multiple Suspicions? intermissions in the margins of each mystery are strategically placed to help you to think like a detective  and like a good
    reader. Their provocative questions prompt you, as you read, to note and track clues and to make predictions while immersed in the mystery.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    How Clever? questions and activities, located immediately after each mysterys conclusion, give practice in the skills of detection and reflection so vital
    to the self-improvement goal of becoming a more observant reader and more mindful thinker. How Clever? sections enable you to review the now-solved
    mystery, analyze the strengths and weaknesses of your own Suspicions? speculations, and evaluate just how capable both you and the storys fictional sleuth
    were in arriving at a solution.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    DetectWrite writing prompts following all the How Clever? sections of each mystery help you to establish your own voice as a more effective writer in a
    variety of writing forms while also giving you many opportunities to write like a detective story author.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    At the very end of the book (but dont jump to any conclusions!), the more than thirty pages of the Dont Peek! section provide one readers commentary:
    mindful explanations and a best reading of the solutions (not necessarily the answers) to the  17 case studies in PLAYING DETECTIVE.
