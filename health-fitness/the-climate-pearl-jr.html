  <title>The Climate - Pearl Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Heres a fascinating new book which answers the question not many have asked, &quot;Where did racism come from and why, the heck, is it still here?&quot;
Pearl Jr. asked this question to herself 30 years ago and has utilized her lifetime to seek the answers.  She says, &quot;this is a book of original thought based solely and purely on facts that are supported by the scholarly community.
The evolution of the races, an analysis of racial origins and habitats, correlated with the development of different psyches marks this book as a first of its kind that proves a theory that just makes sense.  Although race-relations is very complicated, Pearl Jr.s writing style is conversational and easy-to-read.  
The Climate:  A Perspective Unvisited examines the complexities of the world according to race.  Pearl Jr. chronologically details the stimulus that has created the worlds varied racial populations, differences in skin, eye and hair color(texture), as well as gives the reason for the distinguishable eye shape of people from (mainly) Southeast Asia.  At a recent lecture, Pearl Jr. asked, &quot;Am I the only person who wanted to know these answers?&quot;  The audience stood attentively silent waiting to hear more.
This manual is intended to create a new movement that states, &quot;The final phase of equality is within our mind.&quot;  
The era of slavery and the days of Jim Crow are legally abolished but what about mindsets that continue a belief system of inferiority and superiority based on race?  &quot;Were all human beings and there shouldve never been racism. . . racism will go down in history as one of the most disastrous mistakes of mankind&quot; comments, speaker/author/activist, Pearl Jr..
&quot;The story of race is so repugnant that only a truly mature person can handle the truth&quot;--therefore, Pearl Jr. was extremely conscientious about attitudes and wrote this manual with a solidly loving, sympathetic and many times, empathetic tone.  She also states, &quot;the descendants of the oppressor need not feel responsible because the atrocities that racism created are not the fault of anyone living today.&quot;
The Climate:  A Perspective Unvisited has already sparked much discussion and Pearl Jr. is well on her way to becoming an important leader and voice of reason in the struggle to abolish racism in every form.
This is a book for all races; its main theme is education through explanation, because according to Pearl Jr, &quot;We all need to know the truth!&quot;
Since its first quarter 2002 release, The Climate:  A Perspective Unvisited is already in its second printing.
