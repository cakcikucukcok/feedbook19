  <title>Lonely at the Top - Thomas Ph.D. Joiner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Men appear to enjoy many advantages in society-on average they make more money, have more power, and enjoy a greater degree of social freedom than women.  But many men pay a high price for the pursuit of success and power. Taking family and friends for granted, men will often let relationships take a back seat to their professional ambitions, only to ultimately find themselves with few real friends they can rely on in hard times. As a result, they turn to affairs, alcohol, and other self-destructive behaviors. Sadly, millions of men suffer untreated depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this groundbreaking and provocative book, award-winning clinical psychologist Thomas Joiner makes an impassioned call for society to recognize the harmful effects that solitude can have on men.  Drawing on original research done for the National Institute of Mental Health, he focuses on the particular situations that leave men rudderless. He offers advice on support systems that are most useful to men, and he offers prescriptive advice on how men can improve their lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
