  <title>The Ripple Effect - Matt Hockney, Jamie Utt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is my story. I want to share with you how I went from being withdrawn to speaking out, from timid to adventurous, from pitiful to powerful, and from depression to being enthusiastically excited for each day! I am not saying that its a bad thing if you have a withdrawn personality, but for me, I was taught that I was worthless and I wasnt free to be myself. However, my life was radically changed at the Central PA Hugh OBrian Youth Leadership Seminar where I learned that I dont have to judge myself through other peoples eyes and that we all can enjoy being ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this book I will share my journey. I will take you to the deepest, darkest, and most painful times in my life. I will show you how I went from being at rock bottom to climbing to be on top of the world in hopes that you will also get addicted to being high on life, and that you will let that buzz allow you to live your life to the fullest and accomplish all that you desire. You absolutely can do this! &lt;br&gt;
-	Matt Hockney, From the Introduction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Matts book, which is really a manual for living a blissful life, will be read over and over again by its readers. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
-	Geeta Novotny, Award-Winning Singer and Actor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I guarantee not one person left unchanged after Matts inspiring [message] on anti-bullying. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
-	Brendan Brown, DHS Assembly Attendee&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The wisdom and maturity that comes from this young man is inspiring. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
-	Kathryn Davis, WVIA-TV Producer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;His presentation gave inspiration to everyone who heard it, including me. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
-	Carol Foley, CLeW Chairman for Central PA HOBY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;" />
