  <title>Fertility, Pregnancy, and Childbirth: A Gynecologist Answers Your Most Important Questions - Lissa Md Rankin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Previously published as part of WHAT&#39;S UP DOWN THERE?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suppose you had a wise, warm, funny best friend--who just happened to be a gynecologist. You&#39;re out with the girls for cocktails and the conversation turns to sex, and then to girly parts. One by one, you start asking her all the questions you&#39;ve secretly wondered about--and discover that you have a lot in common. If you were to write those questions down, then you&#39;d have FERTILITY, PREGNANCY, AND CHILDBIRTH: A GYNOCOLOGIST ANSWERS YOUR MOST IMPORTANT QUESTIONS, a life-changing little ebook that answers:&lt;br&gt;     - How late is too late to get pregnant?&lt;br&gt;     - Are there sex acts we should acoid if we&#39;re trying to make a baby?  Oral sex? Vibrators? Lubricant? Whipped cream?&lt;br&gt;     - Is it true that sex can stimulate labor?  Is so, will having sex make me deliver early?&lt;br&gt;     - Since I got pregnant, I&#39;m as horny as a teenage boy.  What&#39;s the deal?&lt;br&gt;     - Is natural childbirth really worth it?  I mean, I&#39;m sure it hurts like the dickens, so why would you do it?  Is it really that much better for you and your baby?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so much more! As outrageously funny as it is empowering, this book reveals how to love yourself and your body--and will have you recommending it to every woman you know.&lt;/p&gt;" />
