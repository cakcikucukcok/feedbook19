  <title>Hey Girl, You Can Do It - Betty Jo Marples</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Women of all ages and walks of life are experiencing challenges each and every day.  The pressures of home, family, career and community are overwhelming.  While striving to be everything to everyone, resentment and loss of self-worth evolve.  Actions and attitudes are influenced by past events and have lasting effects upon their lives.&lt;p&gt;  
The world tries to squeeze women into its mold  how to look, act, live, and eat.  These images create the attitude of self-centeredness or its demeaning and women allow the word cant to control them.  Gods Word encourages and tells women how special they are when they put trust in Him. And they can do all things through Christ. &lt;p&gt; 
The reader will discover how to:
Get past the past&lt;br&gt;
Adjust to different seasons in life&lt;br&gt;
See herself as God sees her&lt;br&gt;
Overcome fears and insecurities&lt;br&gt;
Turn negatives into positives&lt;br&gt;
Apply the Word of God&lt;br&gt;
Become a joy-filled woman of God
ENDORSEMENT:  During the years that Pastor Betty Jo has been my friend and mentor, I have witnessed her deep love for others and her heartfelt desire to see us embrace and enjoy all the richness available through Gods Word.  Her encouraging message for todays women is timeless and relevant. ( by Cheryl St. John - Award winning author of  both historical and contemporary novels, teacher, conference speaker and worship leader.)&lt;p&gt;
Betty Jo is a teacher, counselor and writes curriculum for ladies Bible studies and speaker at womens and community groups. She wrote, produced and hosted Lifelines and Heart-to-Heart radio programs.  She and her husband have been pastoring for twenty years and have two daughters, six grandchildren and two great-grandsons." />
