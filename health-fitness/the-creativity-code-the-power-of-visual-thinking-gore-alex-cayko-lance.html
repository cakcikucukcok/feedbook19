  <title>The Creativity Code : The Power of Visual Thinking - Gore Alex, Cayko Lance</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;While it might seem like some people are born with it, the fact is anyone can learn to be creative. Half of the human brain is devoted directly or indirectly to vision - that&amp;#39;s the power of visual thinking. Companies such as Apple, Air B&amp;amp;B and Tesla, have shown that creativity outperforms entrenched thinking. Using architecture, humor and everyday examples, the Creativity Code helps:: &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;- Kickstart your creative thinking &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;- Unlock your visual processing potential &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;- Strengthen your design skills &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;- Discover your inner Da Vinci&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you are struggling in school, interested in architecture, or searching for a way to breakthrough in your profession, then tap into the power of visual thinking. This jam-packed guide will help you find hidden opportunities, solve unique problems, and create what you think is impossible.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Creativity Code&amp;nbsp;is about taking back creativity in a structured way, and making an intangible idea concrete. What&amp;nbsp;better than architecture, a field&amp;nbsp;defined by structure and made with concrete to explore this subject. This book will give you a solid foundation for you to build your ideas on.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The books ingredients were brewed in building a professional architecture firm from scratch during the recession. Its recipe was then tested by hundreds of University students. For 15 years I have been creating designs for my clients and myself. I&amp;rsquo;ve been winning competitions, getting published, and working for top firms in the world. Now I want to help you make your ideas become reality.&lt;/p&gt;" />
