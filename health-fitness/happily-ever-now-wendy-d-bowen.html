  <title>Happily Ever Now - Wendy D Bowen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Happily ever after is what we are conditioned to believe we should strive for. If there was a book with the rules on dating, I am sure that I have broken every one. Our journey to discovering self-worth and self-love is paved with some heartache. The road has potholes that we fall into. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever felt alone when you were with another person? Have you ever had a heartache? Perhaps there have been instances where you did not feel quite good enough. Have you ever wondered why you feel this way and if there is anything you can actually do about it? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Happily Ever Now, you will travel with Wendy on her journey from her first love to the present time. You will gain insight as to how an outgoing, athletic, scholastic young girl could have issues with confidence and self-esteem. Wendy will, from her own experiences, share with you some of the potholes you can hit or fall into. Wendy will also share how she climbed back out and some ways that we all would benefit from to help us avoid these potholes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout Happily Ever Now, Wendy will share some of her favorite quotes as well as some of her own poetry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By sharing her experiences, Wendy hopes that you will find your road to self-love and self-worth, and be able to live Happily Ever Now.Happily ever after is what we are conditioned to believe we should strive for.
