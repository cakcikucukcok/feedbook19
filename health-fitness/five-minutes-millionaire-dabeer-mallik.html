  <title>Five Minutes Millionaire - Dabeer Mallik</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Life is a journey and road is the destination, our value system is our Atlas guide to lifes challenges, and we make our decisions by referring to its maps; our values. Unfortunately a map book drawn by an inexperienced teen-ager is not a reliable guide to steer us through the twists and turns of life, nor is it good for a safe highway driving. We learn our values from our parents and the surroundings.  Most of the parents are/were not versed with the science or art of success, so they passed on the values they knew best; especially if they were poor they may have passed a very limited vision of life to you.  In their opinion, making a living and raising a family were the ultimate challenge, and they may have lovingly and innocently passed them on to you, there by robbing you of your true potential. True potential of any life is no less than Mother Teresa, Gandhi, Donald Trump, Martha Stewart or any other household name. The only difference is Desire, and a proven value system. To succeed in life one needs desire, but most of us dont know where the desires come from or how to create them; for that one needs to understand how our mind functions.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
No doubt Desire, is the starting point of all major success, desire alone is not enough. We also need Faith, a clear unshakable understanding of how Nature or God grants desire that look totally out of our reach. And last but not the least what role, if any does money play in our success, how do they get rich and what can you do to ensure your riches. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
What good is all the success, if we cant even be happy, even though success and possessions have very little to do with happiness if at all. To explain all these issues that involves psychology, metaphysics, spirituality, religion and economics in a book that can be read in two to four hours without putting the reader to a sleep was/is a challenge. This book is specially written for young adults who dont have time or interest in reading such topics.  Five Minute Millionaire draws on solid facts to inspire the reader; it is written in interesting provocative style, in short articles ranging from one line on a page to a maximum of three pages printed in a large font, yet it inspires every reader.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The book comes with optional Instant Motivation, software that lets you see your progress on a daily basis.  They say nothing succeeds like success, when you see your money grow, your health improve and your happiness increase, it reinforces your belief in your thinking, your system and your actions; that is the secret to ultimate success in life, realization of ones full potential." />
