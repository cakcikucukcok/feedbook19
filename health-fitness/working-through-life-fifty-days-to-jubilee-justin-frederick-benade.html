  <title>Working Through Life Fifty Days to Jubilee - Justin Frederick Benade</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It all started when I started school grade one, when my teacher tied me to a chair. From there, my life was hard. I was bullied right through my school days, made fun of, and teased. It was really hard for me as a child. I am still trying to work out why do children do it? Dont they see what they are doing is really breaking children down in spirit and in life?
&lt;p&gt;This book shows how I dealt with it every day. Nowhere in the Bible does it say that life would be easy. I met so many people who went through what I went through. Everyone deals with it in a different way. I concentrated on the word of God.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was talking to a teenager one day, and she had so many problems. Thats when I decided to change my poetry book to a fifty-day diary to help people overcome the obstacles in their life.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By writing this book, I hope people will see what they missed in life. By casting all your burdens on to God, you will be healed. It is not an easy road to walk, and it never will be. But with God by your side, you will make it. I also did some research and found that not a lot of people can concentrate for long on something. Thats why I only made it fifty days. So that people can take time out afterwards and think about the path they walked alone, without God by their side.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My aim in writing this book is that people would see that with God by their side, anything is possible and that they can overcome the biggest obstacle in life and that nothing can hold them back.&lt;p&gt;" />
