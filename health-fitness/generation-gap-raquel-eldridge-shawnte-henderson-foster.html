  <title>Generation Gap - Raquel Eldridge, Shawnte Henderson-Foster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Etienne Lewis is tall, gorgeous, full of swagger, and dreams of being a superstar hip-hop artist. His only roadblockbeing adopted by the Lewises. In order to get more in touch with his roots and boost his street credibility, he moves to the hood, hangs with thugs, and distances himself from everyone who loves him. In the end, will Etienne, aka Gemini, find fame to be everything he hoped it would be? Bryce Lewis couldnt be more different than Etienneeven though hes his identical twin. Bryce, the cerebral one, has plans to fast-track himself through medical school and follow in his fathers doctoral footsteps. Hes proud of his new life and happy to be far away from his sordid roots. Individual freedom is sweet in college, but can a twin ever cut the mental, physical, and emotional umbilical cord from their womb mate? Savannah Lewis is beautiful, sexy, spoiled, popular and is about to turn Sweet Sixteen! She cannot wait until her brothers, Bryce and Etienne, graduate and leave their mutual high school campus so she can let her hair down and be her own person. Is she ready to navigate the perils of impending adulthood without her ever-watchful guardians around to make sure she stays out of troubleand that trouble stays away from her? Isaac Shaw is a brilliant, well-rounded kid, whose passions fall into two categories: football and girlsand not always in that order. His natural knack of using his pretty-boy looks to get what he wants fails to get him the girl of his dreams because she belongs to his best friend. But when his friend is caught with his hand in a different cookie jar, will he swoop in to pick up the pieces of her broken heart? Olivia Shaw may be young and sassy, but shes also very smart and talentedtwo traits she shows off frequently as part of the hip-hop styled dance crew, Divas and Dons." />
