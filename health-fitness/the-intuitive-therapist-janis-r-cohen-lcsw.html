  <title>The Intuitive Therapist - Janis R. Cohen Lcsw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Are you a therapist or counselor who wonders if your intuition can be used to benefit your practice?
The Intuitive Therapist is an informed, practical and broad-scoped discussion of intuition for the therapist: how to recognize it and harness it to more quickly, gently, and effectively transform your clients lives. Written with warmth, compassion and personal insight, The Intuitive Therapist is a must-have reference for any therapist who seeks a more rewarding professional experience. It provides easy, compelling exercises and insights that can upgrade even the occasionally intuitive therapist into a more profoundly effective catalyst for change and healing.
After experiencing a spontaneous deepening of her own intuitive abilities, Cohen developed an innovative approach to her therapeutic practice that led to incredible shifts in her clients progress. Her amped-up intuition gave her a new laser-like ability to identify core issues and led her to redesign her methods to help clients more readily shift their attitudes and perspectives, and greatly improve their quality of life.
In The Intuitive Therapist, youll learn simple yet powerful methods to recognize and cultivate your intuition. Youll learn how developing your intuition can deepen your confidence and sharpen your clarity within your own life and in your practice. Youll discover the power of energy management, strategic intervention, meditation, and other tricks of the trade to energize you and build a more heart-centered and rewarding practice." />
