  <title>Is God Evil? - Mirna Hanna Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Who is God anyway? The old man who created the world in six days and then took Sunday off, or the one who thinks that a man equals two women? What if it was us who created God in our own image and not the opposite? The prolific interpretations of God with their fear-based distortions support this theory. What if the universal recipe for life and happinessor the carrot that donkeys worldwide are pursuingwere as illusionary and deceitful as the numerous personas of God? What if both our fear-based constructs of God and reality were seeded on purpose in order to enslave us in a matrix of cognitive distortions? If so, who benefits from keeping us energetically harnessed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book explores the true nature of God as a consciousness that steps down into manifested form through a basic understanding of the mechanics of co-creation. It also explores the mechanics of miscreation, along with the inorganic nature and consequences of fear, including physical phenomena like the formation of black holes and metaphysical ones like the biblical fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A set of tools is provided for those who wish to detangle themselves from the matrix of fear-based consciousness by reclaiming their initial state of mastery and godhood and becoming the architects of their life in this physical realm and beyond. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information is the highest form of power. From the moment it is acquired, life becomes entirely magical.&lt;/p&gt;" />
