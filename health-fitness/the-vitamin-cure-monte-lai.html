&lt;p&gt;Modern medicine has done much in the field of acute conditions such as trauma, infections, burn, and bone fractures, but it has limited success in treating chronic diseases, such as Alzheimer?s, Parkinson?s, cancer, and diabetes among others. At present, the root causes of most chronic diseases are still unknown, and the drugs developed by pharmaceutical companies to treat chronic diseases actually treat only the symptoms rather than causes.  According to Dr. Monte Lai, a nutrient deficient diet and unhealthy lifestyle are by far the two most important environmental factors associated with the causes of a host of chronic diseases.  &lt;i&gt;The Vitamin Cure&lt;/i&gt; provides a comprehensive overview of how vitamin and essential element therapies are the key to treating and preventing many of the chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
While the internet is chock full of health related information about vitamins and essential elements,  it is difficult to sort through all available information to build a reliable knowledge base to improve health.  The aim of this book is to provide readers with easily accessible evidence-based knowledge about vitamins and essential elements for prevention and treatment of chronic diseases. &lt;i&gt;The Vitamin Cure&lt;/i&gt; relies on a statistical method known as meta-analysis (combining data from multiple studies) that is currently the most reliable method for assessing the efficacy of vitamins or essential elements in preventing or treating chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The Vitamin Cure&lt;/i&gt; brings clinically proven remedies to light for any reader looking to improve overall health and prevent debilitating disease.  This book contains five parts.  Part one contains a brief history of the discovery of each of the thirteen essential vitamins, namely, vitamin A, vitamin B1, vitamin B2, vitamin B3, vitamin B5, vitamin B6, vitamin B7, vitamin B9, vitamin B12, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, and vitamin K. It also presents meta-analytic evidence of the efficacy of each vitamin in prevention and treatment of diseases, its recommended daily allowance and best food sources. Part two covers essential elements, including the five essential elements, i.e., calcium, potassium, sodium, magnesium and phosphorous, and the eight essential trace elements, i.e., iron, zinc, manganese, copper, molybdenum, iodine, chromium and selenium. It also presents meta-analytic evidence of the efficacy of each essential element in prevention and treatment of diseases, its recommended daily allowance and best food sources. Part three explains important secrets for staying healthy. These include explanation of how sugar makes you fat, why patients with autoimmune diseases should not eat meat, and how exercise benefits the brain? Part four provides meta-analysis evidence of which vitamins and essential elements should be taken to prevent and/or treat seventy-five chronic diseases and conditions.  These seventy-five chronic diseases and conditions include lung cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, endometrial cancer, blood cancer, bladder cancer, glioma, diabetes, stroke, heart disease, cataracts, hypertension, Alzheimer?s disease, osteoporosis, arthritis, hepatitis C, fatty liver disease, Parkinson?s disease, sleep apnea, and others.  Part five summarizes clinically proven remedies for preventing and treating the seventy-five chronic diseases and conditions presented in Part four.&lt;/p&gt;
