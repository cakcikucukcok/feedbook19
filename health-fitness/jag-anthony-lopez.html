  <title>Jag - Anthony Lopez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Love unconditionally. Be happy often. Never pass-up a chance for a hug. Be humble. Dont dwell on yesterday, and dont worry about tomorrow. These are only a few of the insightful life lessons captured in this gem of a book. Without ever speaking one word, Jag, has preached, thought, and modeled these, and other Biblical principles for sound Christian living. Imagine a world where we all lived up to these eternal principles! Not only would we lead happier more fulfilled lives, but we would positively impact our family, friends, and our world in an eternal way. - Rick Hawks, Senior Pastor. The Chapel, Fort Wayne, Indiana
Judge Advocate General. Thats his name. Will he go to heaven when he dies? If there are dogs in heaven  and I sure hope there are  then Jag will certainly be there. From the moment he was born he has loved life and lived it to its fullest. He knows how to play, when to ask for help, how to give love, and when to be quiet. Jag has showered each of us with unconditional love and he has made us laugh until we cried. Jag trusts us. He has never worried about yesterday or tomorrow, and he has protected us whenever he thought we needed protecting. Hes been a good and loyal friend, and I have learned much from him. He always gives us exactly what we need when we need it, and Im reminded of that profound truth every time I look at that big furry blessing that is Jag  my trusted confidant, my wise old teacher my best buddy  Anthony Lopez" />
