  <title>My Via Dolorosa - Takamitsu Muraoka</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a collection of reflections written by the author each time after his annual voluntary teaching ministry in Asian countries, which suffered under the Japanese Imperialism and military operations in the first half of the twentieth century. The introductory chapter presents first the authors perspective as a Japanese Christian scholar on his countrys modern history as it relates to its Asian neighbours and the countries that fought with Japan during the Pacific War, and then it explains the authors theological motivation and underpinning of his teaching ministry in Asia. As an appendix, the authors reflections and reservations on the bilateral agreement recently (28.12.2015) reached between the governments of South Korea and Japan over the issue of comfort women are presented. This issue constitutes, in the authors view, a touchstone as to how seriously and sincerely Japan is going to face its war past. In the course of his visits to Asia the matter has hung heavy over the authors chest and he personally met some surviving, elderly Asian victims." />
