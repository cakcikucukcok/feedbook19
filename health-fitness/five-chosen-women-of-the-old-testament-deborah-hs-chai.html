  <title>Five Chosen Women of the Old Testament - Deborah Hs Chai</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This Bible-study material is the product of much time and seeking spent in quietness before God, reading the Word, and listening to the Holy Spirit. It can offer a life-changing exercise for anyone who is hungry for the truth and willing to partner with the Almighty in faith and obedience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why have these women been included in the Bible? Surely it is for our good, so that we can learn from their lives.  And the author finds great peace in being egalitarian in perspective and wants to see many others become secure in their identity in Christ, being sure of oneself, being rooted and established in the love of Christ, per Galatians 3:2629: &quot;For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. And if you are Christs, then you are Abrahams seed, and heirs according to the promise.&quot; (NKJV)&lt;/p&gt;" />
