  <title>Easy To Love, Difficult To Discipline: The 7 Basic Skills For Turning Conflict - Becky A. Bailey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The 7 Basic Skills for Turning Conflict into Cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Have you ever opened your mouth to discipline your child, and your parents&#39; nastiest words tumble out? In an era when most parenting books focus on the child, this book supports parents in dealing more positively with themselves as well as their toddler&amp;ndash;to&amp;ndash;school&amp;ndash;age children, offering specific tools to stop policing and pleading with kids and start being the parents we want to be. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Based on Dr. Bailey&#39;s more than 25 years of work with children, this book explains that how we discipline ourselves is ultimately how we discipline our children. Her &quot;Seven Powers for Self&amp;ndash;Control&quot; dramatically increase our ability to keep our cool with our children. These correspond to &quot;Seven Basic Discipline Skills&quot; we can use with our children in conflict situations. As children internalise these skills, they naturally learn &quot;Seven Values for Living,&quot; which include integrity, respect, compassion, and responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;" />
