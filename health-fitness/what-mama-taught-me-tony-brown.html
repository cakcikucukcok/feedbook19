  <title>What Mama Taught Me - Tony Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Millions of viewers of &lt;em&gt;Tony Brown&#39;s Journal&lt;/em&gt;, the longest-running series on PBS, know Tony Brown as an advocate for self-reliance and self-enrichment. Now, in his most personal book yet, he introduces us to the woman who brought him up and taught him the seven core values he lives by to this day: reality, knowledge, race, history, truth, patience, and love. &lt;em&gt;What Mama Taught Me&lt;/em&gt; states that only by understanding one&#39;s place in the world can one become free in mind and spirit, which is the path to true success. Brown argues that by following other people&#39;s rules, we betray ourselves and our desires, resulting in a vicious cycle of disconnection, unhappiness, and spiritual death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enhanced by the homespun storytelling he heard as a child, this is Brown&#39;s personal recipe for achievement, imparting values that provide a blueprint for reaching success and happiness -- on one&#39;s own terms.&lt;/p&gt;" />
