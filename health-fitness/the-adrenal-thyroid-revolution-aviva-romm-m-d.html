  <title>The Adrenal Thyroid Revolution - Aviva Romm, M.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A Yale-trained, board-certified family physician with a specialty in women&#39;s health and obstetrics delivers a proven 28-day program to heal the overwhelmed, overloaded systems, and prevent and reverse the myriad of symptoms affecting the vast majority of women today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weight gain, fatigue, brain fog, hormonal imbalances, and autoimmune conditions&amp;#8212;for years, health practitioners have commonly viewed each as individual health problems resulting from a patient&amp;#8217;s genetic bad luck, poor lifestyle choices, or lack of willpower. Patients, too, have turned to different doctors to alleviate their specific symptoms: an endocrinologist for a thyroid problem; a gynecologist for hormonal issues; an internist for weight, diabetes, and high blood pressure; a rheumatologist for joint problems, and even to therapists or psychologists. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these ailments may seem unrelated, Dr. Aviva Romm contends that they are intrinsically connected by what she calls Survival Overdrive Syndrome, a condition that occurs when the body becomes overloaded. SOS can result from childhood survival patterns or adult life stressors that are compounded by foods we eat, toxins in our environment, viral infections, lack of sleep, disrupted gut microflora, and even prescribed medications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two of the systems most affected are the adrenal system and the thyroid, which control mood, hormones, inflammation, immunity, energy, weight, will power, blood sugar balance, cholesterol, sleep, and a host of other bodily functions. When these systems become overwhelmed they lead to symptoms that can develop into full blow illnesses, including diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis, and heart disease&amp;#8212;all of which have medically provable origins in SOS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Adrenal Thyroid Revolution&lt;/em&gt; explains SOS, how it impacts our bodies and can lead to illness, and most importantly, offers a drug-free cure developed through Dr. Romm&amp;#8217;s research and clinical work with tens of thousands of patients. In as little as two weeks, you can lose excess weight, discover increased energy, improve sleep, and feel better. With &lt;em&gt;The Adrenal Thyroid Revolution&lt;/em&gt;, you can rescue your metabolism, hormones, mind and mood&amp;#8212;and achieve long-lasting health. &lt;/p&gt;" />
