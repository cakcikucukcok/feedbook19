  <title>A Flight of Delight - Jyotikar K Pattni</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;A Flight of Delight&lt;/B&gt; is a work of experiential philosophical text that contemplates the nature of such subtle topics as Karmic evolution, Divine Cosmic Truth, and the relationship between Divinity and Humankind. Utilising an expressive narrative approach that places emphasis on description and aesthetics finely, the author has endeavoured to render a thought provoking analysis in a prose poetic style. The fine text touches the core concepts of theology that look at life as a freely flowing channel of energies in profound human experiences. One of the central ideas of the work is the difference between institutional religion and experiential philosophy, with the conceptual emphasis leaning toward the latter. Fear destroys true faith.  Institutional religion is constrictive that remains fixated on rules, systems, and political bureaucracies. A profound human spiritualism on the other hand suggests a cyclical direction of energy that flows without fear, suppression, oppression, exploitation, manipulation, and falsity. Realising and understanding compassion and love is much more important and significant than following set of doctrines in conflict. This is attainable in spiritual evolution - a self-discovery in profound experiences without the confines of specific creed, cast, or race. The discourse includes detailed explorations of different types of Vedic yoga&#39;s, mantras, and consciousness. The emphasis placed on the pursuit of divine wisdom and divinity incorporates all of these elements to form a comprehensive insight of profound experience for the inner well-ness and peace. The reader of &lt;b&gt;&#39;A Flight of Delight&#39;&lt;/b&gt; may also benefit from the organised structure afforded to the text. The detailed explanation of the experiential theories familiarises the reader with carefully distilled notions of spiritualism and divinity. Here is an extra ordinary work of self-healing texts from a very special person who has journeyed through adversities himself. The lyrics of this book are particularly special because the author writes from the depth of his heart, to express in the profoundest sense, the relevance of the ancient Vedic Wisdom to the hectic modern world. The mind enriching lyrics bring to us a re-awakening of beautiful divinity filled with solace, hope, and compassionate love. Life oh life! Let it be &#39;a flight of delight&#39;." />
