  <title>The Candida Cure - Ann Boroch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foreword by David Perlmutter, MD, author of &lt;em&gt;Grain Brain&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The&amp;#160;cult-classic health book, now revised and updated with a quick start cleanse, easy recipes, and more.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not news that Americans are sicker than ever. Seventy million of us suffer from digestive problems like acid reflux, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), or gastro esophageal reflex disorder (GERD). Another forty million have been diagnosed with anxiety and/or depression and a staggering fifty million Americans live with an autoimmune disease. But what is newsworthy is that all of these conditions share a common thread you&amp;#8217;ve probably never heard of: candida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Candida&quot; is the term for a group of yeast organisms that have lived in our digestive tract for millennia, in harmony with the other thousands of bacteria, viruses, and archaea that make up our microbiome. But due to poor diets, processed foods, overuse of antibiotics, environmental toxins, and increased stress, our microbiome has been under steady and constant attack for decades. Yeast are of a heartier stock than bacterial microbes, and as bacteria die off, yeast begins to overgrow in the digestive tract, a condition known as candidiasis. Mild and moderate cases of candidiasis present with fatigue, IBS, eczema, depression, brain fog, migraines, and weight gain. Severe cases allow the afflicted to develop autoimmune disease (such as Multiple Sclerosis), cancer, and Alzheimer&amp;#8217;s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ann Boroch&amp;#8217;s self-published book, &lt;em&gt;The Candida Cure&lt;/em&gt;, has been the #1 resource in candida treatment since 2008. Her program&amp;#8212;which she used to heal herself from a life-threatening autoimmune disorder&amp;#8212;has stood the test of time, and has become a life-changing resource for more than 65,000 people. Now, in this revised edition,&amp;#160; readers have even more tools, with updated information and case histories, a quick start cleanse, and all-new recipes and eating plans.&lt;/p&gt;" />
