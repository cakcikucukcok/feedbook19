  <title>The Fine Art of Fine Dining - Chinha Raheja</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In todays increasingly casual world, the only way to stand out of the crowd is to exhibit the highest standards of etiquette. 
Proper etiquette sets you apart from competition. Since todays success strategy is Entertaining, it is essential that you feel confident in all dining situations by knowing and exhibiting exquisite table manners. Using the system in this book will not only help you become a pro at dining at Western or Indian cuisine, it will also guide you on what is acceptable globally on dining tables across the world! This book also offers interesting Wine and Dine rules of various countries for the globetrotting professional.
The Fine Art of Fine Dining is essential for anyone who wants to learn the nuances of business dining. Chinha has an easy to read style of writing which apart from being informative is also entertaining. I loved reading it and I feel this book is a must have for every professional, entrepreneur and global traveler. I applaud her on educating the Indian people on how to adapt western dining etiquette to Indian food. This is truly an asset to cherish.

This is a must read book if you are serious about making an impression on the dining table. Chinha has a common sense approach to manners which is seen and felt in every word of her book. This is an easy to read catalogue of what to do in business dining situations, which can also be applied to any social environment. As the world grows more casual day by day and common courtesies become more lax, this book is a refresher course on how to behave on the table for people who already know, and a wonderful resource for people learning dining etiquette. It is simply a must have guide if you want to further your career or business in a shrinking world.

Chinha Rahejas book is helpful for everyone- from homemakers to topnotch business professionals and business owners!  It explains those social situations where you dont know what to do or what to say. Chinha shares what it means to be a polite and gracious person in your family, your circle of friends, at work and in society in general. Chinha also explains the proper responses to tricky things, like who to invite to a gathering or how to graciously thank people and know when to say no to a guest. I find it truly refreshing and a great resource. Just for the sake of knowing your Etiquettogram Quotient the book is worth the buy!
