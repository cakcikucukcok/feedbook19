  <title>Teaching Empathy and Conflict Resolution to People with Dementia - Cameron Camp, Linda Camp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The way in which dementia is understood and treated is changing, with a growing focus on the individual&#39;s experience and person-centred approaches to care. Introducing a new model of dementia care that reflects on the role of a person with dementia within a community and their relationships, this guide for professional and family caregivers demonstrates how to facilitate positive relationships for peaceful living.
By understanding the cognitive and physical challenges that older adults with dementia face, caregivers can practice empathic care that affords people with dementia increased freedom of expression and independence. Included here are techniques for conflict resolution that enable people with dementia to be active and self-initiating in times of distress and disruption. Looking at the basics of respect, empathy, and mindfulness, this book also provides hands-on training for employing these virtues in practice with a number of exercises to help achieve the goal of peaceful independent living." />
