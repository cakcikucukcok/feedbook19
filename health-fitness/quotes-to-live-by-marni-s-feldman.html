  <title>Quotes to Live by . . . - Marni S. Feldman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="To say the least, they mentioned, With all your quotes, you should write a book. 
I thought to myself, That is a wonderful idea, and they just poured out of me.
I compiled them one by one, hour by hour, day by day, year by year, into one book. As I love quotes and sayings and clichs on anything. I love little hardback books, softback pocket guides, and so on. Im drawn to quotes, and I know people are as they live by them: day by day! 
However, I then decided to break them down by category, by mood, by feeling, and by emotion, and they became chapters in the book: Inspirational, General, Spiritual, etc.
For fun, I wanted to create some T-shirts, as I love baby tees. I love tissue cotton tees. I love characters and sayings on tees. I was going to make them with some simple sayings, but they took on lives of their own. The tees are pieces of artwork, such as the chapters in the books. I am drawn to them, and I know people are too, so that is why combining them, I feel, is such as neat way to express this unique concept.
And that is how Quotes to Live By books (by Think Again!) and Quotes tees (by luminous) were born. Its a timeless era. Its a lifestyle. Its a way of life. They are quotes to live by, so think again. Remember the Quotes, and always be luminous.
