  <title>Crash Test Girl - Kari Byron</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kari Byron&amp;#8212;former host of the wildly popular, iconic cult classic &lt;em&gt;MythBusters&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8212;shows how to crash test your way through life, no lab coat required. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kari Byron&amp;#8217;s story hasn&amp;#8217;t been a straight line. She started out as a broke artist living in San Francisco, writing poems on a crowded bus on the way to one of her three jobs. Many curve balls, unexpected twists, and yes, literal and figurative explosions later, and she&amp;#8217;s one of the world&amp;#8217;s most respected women in science entertainment, blowing stuff up on national television and getting paid for it! In &lt;em&gt;Crash Test Girl&lt;/em&gt;, Kari reveals her fascinating life story on the set of &lt;em&gt;MythBusters&lt;/em&gt; and beyond. With her signature gusto and roll-up-your-sleeves enthusiasm, she invites readers behind the duct tape and the dynamite, to the unlikely friendships and low-budget sets that turned a crazy idea into a famously inventive show with a rabid fanbase. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth is, &lt;em&gt;Mythbusters&lt;/em&gt; was never meant to be a science show. But attaching a rocket to a car, riding a motorcycle on water, or lighting 500 pounds of coffee creamer on fire requires a decent understanding of chemistry, physics, and engineering. Thus, the cast and crew brought in the scientific method to work through each problem: Question. Hypothesize. Experiment. Analyze.&amp;#160;Conclude. And as Kari came to learn in her own life, not only is the scientific method the best approach for busting myths, it&amp;#8217;s also the perfect tool for solving everyday issues, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Career &amp;#183; Love &amp;#183; Creativity &amp;#183; Setbacks &amp;#183; Money &amp;#183; Sexuality &amp;#183; Depression &amp;#183; Bravery&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crash Test Girl&lt;/em&gt; reminds us that science is for everyone, as long as you&amp;#8217;re willing to strap in, put on your safety goggles, hit a few walls, and learn from the results. Using a combination of methodical experimentation and unconventional creativity, you&amp;#8217;ll come to the most important conclusion of all: In life, sometimes you crash and burn, but you can always crash and learn.&lt;/p&gt;" />
