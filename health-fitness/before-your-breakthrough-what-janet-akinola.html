  <title>Before Your Breakthrough:What? - Janet Akinola</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Life journey is like the roads in our societies. One road leads to another. There are junctions and crossroad. The road differs in certain areas. Some parts are flat and smooth allowing quick movement while others are steep, rough and curvy requiring users to slow down and be cautious. 
The way to a mans breakthrough is not always smooth but sometimes demanding and rough. It is usually challenging. It takes dedication and commitment with Gods grace to keep moving forward without stopping. Such challenges can lead us to the right place or person through whom our breakthrough will come. Example is Isaac in the Bible who encountered much difficulties yet he continued to move forward to dig other wells, until he got to Beersheba, a place of his breakthrough. 
Good attitude such as endurance, dedication and persistence are required to be able to continue in such journey of life till the breakthrough point." />
