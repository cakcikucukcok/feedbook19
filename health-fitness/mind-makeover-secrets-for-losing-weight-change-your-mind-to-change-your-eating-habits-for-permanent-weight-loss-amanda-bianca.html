  <title>Mind Makeover Secrets for Losing Weight: Change Your Mind to Change Your Eating Habits for Permanent Weight Loss - Amanda Bianca</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Most people want to lose weight but failed because they start making changes from the food they eat, this books tells you that you should never start from food but from the mind. You can try all the diet programs in the world or try all kinds of exercise programs but none of these is going to help you lose weight. This is because losing weight is not just about dieting or exercise. The old formula of Weight Loss = Diet + Exercise does not work! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mind Makeover Secrets For Losing Weight will help you to lose the weight you always wanted after you have understood and apply the principles behind it. In this book, you will learn that before you can change your weight, you must change your mind. Most people go on a diet like they go for a vacation. After the vacation, they go back to the same old lifestyle and this is why they will eventually put back whatever weight they have lost. You don&amp;#39;t want your weight loss to be temporary, you want permanent weight loss. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To achieve permanent weight loss, you first have to change your mind. Permanent weight loss requires a personal change in thoughts and actions. The most effective weight loss machine is not the latest exercise equipment but your MIND. In order to change your eating habits or to force yourself to do some exercise requires a tremendous amount of self-discipline and willpower that most people do not have. To have willpower means you must have mind power. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CHAPTER 1: The Power of Intention &lt;br&gt;This chapter prepares your mind to be clear and ready to commit to lose weight which is the start of your weight loss success.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CHAPTER 2:  Mental Barriers That Prevent You From Eating And Living Healthy&lt;br&gt;This chapter shows you the greatest mental barriers that are stopping you from achieving success in your weight loss journey and how to overcome them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CHAPTER 3:  How Your Emotions Sabotage You&lt;br&gt;This chapter covers the types of emotions that are causing your bad eating habits leading to your weight problem and how to remove them completely. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CHAPTER 4:  The Power Of The Subconscious Mind&lt;br&gt;This chapter teaches you how to use affirmations and visualizations to program your mind to want to live healthy and eat healthy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CHAPTER 5:  The Power of Actions &lt;br&gt;This chapter shows you the actions you need to take to program your mind to stick to your weight loss routine. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CHAPTER 6: Three Changes In Your Lifestyle&lt;br&gt;This chapter teaches you the 3 major actions and changes you must take to achieve success in losing weight. These 3 actions will lead you to the ultimate transformation and permanent weight loss." />
