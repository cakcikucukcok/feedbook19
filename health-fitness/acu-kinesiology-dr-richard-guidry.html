  <title>Acu Kinesiology - Dr. Richard Guidry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This could possibly be the most important book you will ever read concerning the quality of life in the domain of health and spiritual connection to Divine Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For every physical ailment there is an energetic pathology involved. It is impossible to get maximum correction in the most expedient manner, unless this energetic element is addressed. Most people in America are unaware of this energetic element. This book will introduce to you your energetic self through the four components of the Acupuncture System. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are numerous energetic healing modalities used around the world that use the principles of the Acupuncture System as a foundation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acu Kinesiology is a system based on the principles of the Eight Extraordinary Meridians, the main operating system of Acupuncture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acu Kinesiology integrates the Chakra System and the Musculo-tendeno Meridians System into the healing equation, which accounts for the exceptional speed and longevity of recovery. Acu Kinesiology effectively releases the contraction caused by energetic pathologies, enabling patients to experience symptomatic relief. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book will reveal the ways in which our energetic self is associated with the mental, emotional and spiritual aspects of life. Our quality of life is determined by how good we feel in these relationships to our energetic self. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we are attuned to the flow of Divine Spirit through our energetic body, the quality of our well-being is higher. &lt;/p&gt;" />
