  <title>The Journey Through Cancer How to Lose 25 lbs. Without Diet or Exercise and be Cancer Free in 8 Months - Jim Serritella</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The ER doctor said, &amp;quot;Let&amp;#39;s take a chest x-ray just to be safe.&amp;quot; The results were simple, the sentence easily stated, and the next time period of life was about to be defined. &amp;quot;There is a white spot on the top right lung. You&amp;#39;d better have your doctor look at this!&amp;quot; That spot turned out to be lung cancer, and with that diagnosis Jim and Betty Serritella began a journey of tests and treatment on the road to becoming cancer-free.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fighting and winning the battle with cancer is a long and arduous process. You need a team of doctors and nurses you can trust, friends and loved ones to provide support, and lots of prayer. The Journey Through Cancer is a road map of the process Jim and Betty followed to battle Betty&amp;#39;s lung cancer. Jim wrote this book to help provide guidance for those on their own cancer journey, especially the caregivers and patient advocates, and to share lessons they learned along the way.&lt;/p&gt;" />
