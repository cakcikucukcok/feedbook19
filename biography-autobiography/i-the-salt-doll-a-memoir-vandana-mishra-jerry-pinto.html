  <title>I, The Salt Doll: A Memoir - Vandana Mishra, Jerry Pinto</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sushila Lotlikar was barely in her teens when tragedy forced her to give up her education and join Parshwanath Altekar&amp;rsquo;s Little Theatre in Mumbai in 1940. But the young Konkani girl soon became a hit on the Gujarati stage and went on to storm the Marwadi stage. And then, at the age of twenty-one, she retired. Taking her mother&amp;rsquo;s advice&amp;mdash;&amp;lsquo;The world of cinema and theatre is like a coal shop, your hands are going to get black&amp;rsquo;&amp;mdash;she married actor-writer Pandit Jaydeo Mishra and &amp;lsquo;moulted&amp;rsquo; into Vandana Mishra. But in a singular twist of fate she was to return to the stage twenty-two years later and begin another glorious innings as a character actor.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;em&gt;I, the Salt Doll&lt;/em&gt; is the story of an exceptional woman&amp;mdash;talented, resilient and possessed of a tremendous zest for life. Equally, it is an engaging chronicle of an entire era&amp;mdash;of life in India over half a century, beginning in the early 1930s. It is also a compelling portrait of Mumbai&amp;mdash;seen from within; from the stage, from the heart of the old city, from the new suburbs&amp;mdash;and in its own quiet way, a plea for the pluralism and diversity that made it a great metropolis.&lt;br /&gt; Vandana Mishra lived through some &amp;lsquo;interesting times&amp;rsquo;, and her singular voice in this narrative laced with songs and sayings will ring in your ears long after you have put the book down.&lt;/p&gt;" />
