  <title>Actors&#39; Voices: The People Behind the Perfomances - Patrick O&#39;Kane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In conversation with Patrick O&#39;Kane, eleven experienced actors who have made a living, a life, in theatre, television and film, share their process, comment on their experiences and consider their role as theatre artists within the broader spectrum of Art and Culture. Contributors, who have worked across a range of forms from mainstream theatre to experimental performance practice, include: Claire Price, Ruairi Conaghan, Mojisola Adebayo, Tim Crouch, Olwen Fouéré, Gerrard McArthur, Gabriel Gawin, Selina Cadell, Simon Russell Beale, Paterson Joseph and Jim Norton.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; A book that actors can mine for tips on craftsmanship and the business. A book that reveals to directors which approaches enable actors and which block them. A book that calls the UK industry to attention: actors should be embraced as primary creators along with the writer, director and designer of any production. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;The book is a rare creature, offering privileged and disarmingly frank encounters with the people behind the performances. It will engage anyone involved in or in love with theatre - practitioners, critics, customers, administrators, agents, teachers, students&quot; - &lt;i&gt;Irish Theatre&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;An excellent exposé of the trials and tribulations, joys and insecurities of a life on the stage.&quot; - &lt;i&gt;British Theatre Guide&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Plenty of tips here both on actor craftsmanship and on how the industry works... the real strength of O&#39;Kane&#39;s book is its breadth&quot; - &lt;i&gt;The Stage&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;This is a book about the precious dedication that makes this profession ancient and new. A clutch of wonderful minds provoked, represent the important ongoing conversation about stories, skill and life. It&#39;s a treat.&quot; - Fiona Shaw&lt;/p&gt;" />
