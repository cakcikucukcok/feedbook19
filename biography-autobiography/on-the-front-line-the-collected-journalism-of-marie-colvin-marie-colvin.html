  <title>On the Front Line: The Collected Journalism of Marie Colvin - Marie Colvin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Veteran Sunday Times war correspondent, Marie Colvin was killed in February 2012 when covering the uprising in Syria.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the Front Line&lt;/em&gt; is an Orwell Special Prize winning journalism collection from veteran war correspondent Marie Colvin, who is the subject of the movie A Private War, starring Rosamund Pike and Jamie Dornan.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Marie Colvin held a profound belief in the pursuit of truth, and the courage and humanity of her work was deeply admired. On the Front Line includes her various interviews with Yasser Arafat and Colonel Gadaffi; reports from East Timor in 1999 where she shamed the UN into protecting its refugees; accounts of her terrifying escape from the Russian army in Chechnya; and reports from the strongholds of the Sri Lankan Tamil Tigers where she was hit by shrapnel, leaving her blind in one eye.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Typically, however, her new eye-patch only reinforced Colvin’s sense of humour and selfless conviction. She returned quickly to the front line, reporting on 9/11, Afghanistan, Iraq, Gaza and, lately, the Arab Spring.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Immediate and compelling, On the Front Line is a street-view of the historic events that have shaped the last 25 years, from an award-winning foreign correspondent and the outstanding journalist of her generation.&lt;/p&gt;
