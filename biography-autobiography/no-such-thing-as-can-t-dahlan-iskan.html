  <title>No Such Thing as Can’T - Dahlan Iskan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="NISP BANK In the waning days of Dutch rule over Indonesia, a poor Chinese merchant bought the license to a bank named NV Nederlandsch Indische Spaar en Deposito (NISP) paid by his assets to the last pennies., and ran the bank successfully. By tradtition, he was obligated to express his gratitude for the fortune by paying homage to his ancestors burial place in China. His return to Indonesia, however, was hindered for a long 16 years. The responsibility for the bank, which had been ruined by senior managers&#39; embezzlement, fell to his son-in-law, Karmaka, a teacher with only a high school degree. Through die-hard determination, and a noble personality of respect to elsders, true to his words, fair play with enemies, and compassion to the meeks, Karmaka overcame incredible calamities, including the national economic turmoil of 1960 and the Asian economic crisis of 1997, and grave threats to his health that resulted in risky liver and kidney transplants. Karmaka and his resourceful wife not only kept NISP alive and thriving, but also molded the character of their five children, two of whom became the bank&#39;s executives. A solid partnership with IFC-World Bank Group and OCBC Bank of Singapore has paved the way for NISP, recognized as the sole survivor from the past 70 years of Indonesian private banking history, to rise even further in the new millennium. &quot;It has been really a pleasure and privilege to have Pak Karmaka as a very good friend and reliable partner for many years. We greatly admire his strong determination in saving as well as rebuilding Bank NISP and guiding the merger of OCBC and NISP. We have full confidence that our partnership in Bank OCBC NISP will be a truly successful one. - Mr Lee Seng Wee, former Chairman,OCBC Bank Group.&quot; Author Resume: DAHLAN ISKAN Mr. Dahlan Iskan is an accomplished entrepreneur and author of several best selling books. Starting as a reporter and driven by his extraordinary hard work and entrepreneurial skills, within 12 years Dahlan became the CEO of an ailing regional paper, Jawa Post, which, under his leadership, was transformed into a major news network with over 80 newspapers, tabloids, magazines and a series of TV stations and a book publisher. In December 2009, the Indonesian government appointed him to be the CEO of an ailing state-owned electrical company, PLN. Rather than demanding CEO perks, he drives his own car, lives in his own house, and asks for no bonuses (2). Dahlan is a civil servant with a golden heart. His appearance is unassuming, very simple and easy going. As a fellow liver transplant patient, Karmaka visited him to share how to care for a new liver, but Dahlan ended up discovering Karmaka&#39;s amazing life story. The narration became a book, which was an instant best seller that inspired people to face life&#39;s challenges and the younger generation to build their future. Translator Resume: SIMON RUSMIN Dr. Simon Rusmin is Karmaka&#39;s childhood friend and fellow teacher, who went to the USA, obtained his Ph.D. in Life Sciences and established his career as quality assurance manager/director of pharmaceutical / biotechnology companies. His life has been constantly intertwined with that of Karmaka and his family. He lauded Karmaka as an exemplar of Chinese descendants in South East Asia who fully give their lives for the prosperity of their home country." />
