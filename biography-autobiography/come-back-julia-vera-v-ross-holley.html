  <title>Come Back, Julia! - Vera V. Ross-Holley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;IF one day you notice that the eyes of a family member or even a friend show signs of sadness or confusion, just stop whatever you are doing and give that person a hug. The hug probably will not make things better; but if the very next moment ushers in the beginning of a journey into the mysterious world of Alzheimers Disease or dementia, the hug will have lasting memories. Come Back, Julia: A Story of Love, Loves Lost, Abuse and a Come Back, takes you, the reader, into such a strange world. Its a story about those unpredictable encounters that life tends to throw into our paths. Then again, some may see
this as a story about lifes ups and downs with no simple solutions for dealing with the difficulties that often kick us down. For those who have been charged as the caretakers, you will find in this book that your faith will help you to understand your calling as you struggle to fulfill your obligations to those who may be in need of someone to just hold their hands and whisper, Everything will be all right!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers, who have family members, friends, or neighbors with dementia, may find this reference to resources valuable. Physicians, who are treating patients with dementia, may also find this reference book useful as they explore the lived experiences of Julia, a person with dementia. There is much to learn about dementia or Alzheimers disease; and there is probably no better way to explore the disease further than by observing and interacting with the person with the disease and his/her caregivers..&lt;/p&gt;" />
