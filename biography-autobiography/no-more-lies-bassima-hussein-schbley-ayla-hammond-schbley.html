  <title>No More Lies - Bassima Hussein Schbley, Ayla Hammond Schbley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;No More Lies details the life and struggles of Dr. Ayla Schbley from his own perspective. Despite the verbose and ornate writing style, Dr. Schbley manages to pack his autobiography with meaningful action. As you progress through No More Lies it becomes apparent that Dr. Schbley is detailing a life that most could never imagine to be real. No More Lies is one of the most believable works to portray the sanguine activities of a modern day James Bond story. This post humus work has been completed by Dr. Schbleys wife: Dr. Bassima Schbley. Ayla Schbley is survived by his wife Bassima and his two sons Sean and Oliver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always referred to Ayla as the real James Bond as he had all the traits, special skills/talents, training, courage, smarts, and physical capabilities of such a movie hero as James Bond was. But Ayla was for real and Bond was not.&lt;/p&gt;
