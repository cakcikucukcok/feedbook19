  <title>Letters to the Dead: Things I Wish I&#39;d Said - Ann Palmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;With loving respect and a desire to pay homage to many who have passed on and to help keep their personalities and talents alive in the public&#39;s mind, I wrote letters to the following celebrities and special people in my life: Orson Welles, Gary Cooper, Grace Kelly, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Bill Bryant, Howard Hawks, Robert Mitchum, David Janssen, Audrey Hepburn, George Peppard, Steve McQueen, Natalie Wood, Milton Krasner, Walter Matthau, Ray Walston, Rock Hudson, Cornel Wilde, Gardner McKay, Fred Holliday, John Carroll, Rex Harrison, Jessica Tandy &amp; Hume Cronin, Richard Burton, Desmond Llewelyn, Joseph L. Mankiewicz, Leon Shamroy, Stuart Lyons, Joan Jones, Arthur Shields, Harry Guardino, Nick Colasanto, Vince Edwards, Red Skelton, Bob Hope, Jayne Mansfield, Joan Crawford, Charles Bronson, Leon Mirell, Rick Jason, Richard E. Lyons, John Bernardino, Norma Connolly, Emily McLaughlin, David Lewis. And my family and friends: Richard Castle, Helen Coffey, Mary, Jack Kogel, my father, my mother, Dr. Richard E. Goodrich, and my daughter Debbie. This is my last tribute to many of those wonderful souls that passed through my life that I honor in this way.  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;About the Author&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Ann Palmer began her TV career in Dallas, Texas in commercials and fashion modeling, which inspired her to take a chance on Hollywood. Torn between on camera performer and behind the scenes production, she did both for a number of years; including on camera in some 75 national commercials, many major films, including under contract to 20th Century Fox for &lt;i&gt;Cleopatra&lt;/i&gt;, TV shows through the years, including 13 years on &lt;i&gt;General Hospital&lt;/i&gt;. She was a producer for the Erwin-Wasey Ad Agency, a casting director, production assistant and worked all phases of pre and post production. Ann produced over 250 programs while at BHTV and continues now and then. She often tapes the places she visits for future productions. She is an ordained minister and also officiates at weddings." />
