  <title>Anxiety Is Not Depression - Cliff Wise</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Anxiety, Depression, and other mental afflictions are regretfully shunned by a society that favors winners. Losers are discarded or left to their own devices in most cases, like I was. This book is an inside, non-medical, non-scientific look inside the brain and life of a person whose life has been dominated by anxiety with a good measure of depression thrown in. It is a summary of methods that the author has employed to fight an invisible lifelong foe, the way the methods were discovered, and their effect. The objective is to provide the sufferer with the feeling that they are not alone, that there is someone else out there like &quot;me.&quot; The first person is used to bring reality to this struggle and to give examplessome humorous in a self-depreciative wayof how things worked out. There is a slow buildup over time of an understanding of the issues that the medicine of the time was not able to provide and mostly does not provide today. At the end, values are assigned in a general sense to more than eighty-five methods (used over about sixty-four years of living) found in this book.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Advice: Do not buy this book and give it to someone else without reading it first to find out in your own opinion if it will be helpful to them. If you do and I find out about it, I will hunt you down and give you a solid thrashing. If you want to tell your friends that you were recently thrashed by a senior citizen, dont take my advice.&lt;/P&gt;" />
