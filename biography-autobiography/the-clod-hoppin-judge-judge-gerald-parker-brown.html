  <title>The Clod-Hoppin’ Judge - Judge Gerald Parker Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It was a hot August day in 1920 when a man rode on horseback away from his forty-acre Arkansas farm to fetch a doctor. His son, Gerald Brown, was about to be born. A short time later as he gazed at the tiny baby in his arms, he had no idea that Gerald would one day be the first in his family to graduate high school and collegeeventually becoming become a trial lawyer and a state Supreme Court judge.
In his compelling narrative that details his fascinating life story, Gerald shares a chronological glimpse into what it was like to grow up on a farm where his father plowed with mules. He attended a one-room school, rode a work horse seven miles to high school, and took a bath only one night a week. Even as the devastation of the Great Depression loomed around him, Gerald nurtured a dream to become something morea dream that led him to serving as a marine in World War II and later attending college on the GI Bill. 
&lt;i&gt;The Clod-Hoppin Judge: Memoirs of Judge Gerald Parker Brown&lt;/i&gt; is the inspirational story of how an Arkansas farm boy overcame insurmountable odds to achieve professional success and personal fulfillment." />
