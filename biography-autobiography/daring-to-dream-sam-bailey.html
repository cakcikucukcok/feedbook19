  <title>Daring to Dream - Sam Bailey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this wonderful and honest book, The X Factor winner and bona fide pop star Sam Bailey tells her unique story and reveals what happens when you have the courage to follow your dreams.  Born in south-east London, Sam always loved to sing and was encouraged by her mother to enter talent shows from an early age. Overcoming her shyness, Sam soon realized her true calling in life was to entertain and perform, and she slowly began taking steps along the rocky road to super-stardom. From the ups and downs of working as an entertainer at a Pontins holiday camp, to the endless grind of the cruise ship circuit, Sam always dreamed of making it to the top. Years later she began work as a prison officer and continued pursuing her singing career in fits and starts. Inspired to audition for the UK&amp;#8217;s biggest talent show, Sam stood in front of The X Factor panel and sang &amp;#145;Listen&amp;#8217; by one of her favourite artists, Beyonc&amp;#233;. Fast forward a year later and Sam was supporting Beyonc&amp;#233; on her world tour, having seen both her debut single and album go straight to number one.  From the grind of the amateur singing circuit and the highs and lows of The X Factor, to the pressures of juggling a music career while being a full-time mum, Daring to Dream is a roller coaster ride of emotion and a wonderful story of courage and sheer determination." />
