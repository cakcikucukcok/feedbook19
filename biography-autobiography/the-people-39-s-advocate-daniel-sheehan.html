  <title>The People&#39;s Advocate - Daniel  Sheehan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;I&gt;The People&amp;#8217;s Advocate&lt;/I&gt; is the autobiography of American Constitutional Trial Attorney Daniel Sheehan. Sheehan traces his personal journey from his working-class roots through Harvard Law School and his initial career in private practice. His early disenchantment led to his return for further study at Harvard Divinity School, and rethinking the nature of his career. Eventually his role as President and Chief Trial Counselor for the famous Washington, D.C.-based Christic Institute would help define his role as America&amp;#8217;s preeminent cause lawyer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In &lt;I&gt;The People&amp;#8217;s Advocate&lt;/I&gt;, Sheehan details &amp;#147;the inside story&amp;#8221; of over a dozen historically significant American legal cases of the 20th Century, all of which he litigated. The remarkable cases covered in the book include both &lt;I&gt;The Pentagon Papers Case&lt;/I&gt; in 1971 and &lt;I&gt;The Watergate Burglary Case&lt;/I&gt; in 1973. In addition, Sheehan served as the Chief Attorney on &lt;I&gt;The Karen Silkwood Case&lt;/I&gt;  in 1976, which additionally revealed the C.I.A.&amp;#8217;s Israeli Desk had been smuggling 98% bomb-grade plutonium to the State of Israel and to Iran. In 1984, he was the Chief Trial Counsel on &lt;I&gt;The American Sanctuary Movement Case&lt;/I&gt;, establishing the right of American church workers to provide assistance to Central American political refugees fleeing Guatemalan and Salvadorian &amp;#147;death squads.&amp;#8221; His involvement with the sanctuary movement ultimately led to Sheehan&amp;#8217;s famous &lt;I&gt;Iran/Contra Federal Civil Racketeering Case&lt;/I&gt; against the Reagan/Bush Administration, which he investigated, initiated, filed, and then litigated. The resulting &amp;#147;Iran/Contra Scandal&amp;#8221; nearly brought down that Administration, leading Congress to consider the impeachment over a dozen of the top-ranking officials of the Reagan/Bush Administration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;The People&amp;#8217;s Advocate&lt;/I&gt; is the &amp;#147;real story&amp;#8221; of these and many other historic American cases, told from the unique point of view of a central lawyer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
