  <title>Every Shitty Thing - Marcia Abboud</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sometimes the biggest mistakes of our lives turn out to be the greatest miracles&amp;hellip;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time Marcia was a teenager, she had been betrayed by every male in her life. Her childhood of abuse, insecurity and self-loathing was spent in the working-class suburbs of Sydney in the 1970s. Food was her only solace, a gypsy life her dream. But at the edge of the abyss, there was light in the darkness: her daughter.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Every Shitty Thing&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is about betrayal, deception, heartbreak and endurance, with humour between the threads, and it&amp;rsquo;s a story of hope, of never giving up on love, of learning to trust again. This is Marcia&amp;rsquo;s story, and how she came to understand that whatever shit we endure leads us to where we need to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRAISE for&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Every Shitty Thing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t put it down. I read&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Every Shitty Thing&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;in one sitting. I felt like I inhaled and didn&amp;#39;t exhale until I&amp;#39;d consumed all of it. An engrossing and agonising read... just when I thought nothing worse could happen ... it did... but at the same time the story is engaging, witty and warm. This is a book about courage and resilience, and what it means to keep showing up even when the odds are stacked against you. Marcia writes bravely and fearlessly. Thank you for sharing your story. Especially the difficult parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;~ Kate Shand, Author&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Every Shitty Thing&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a heart-wrenching tale that peels back the cover of childhood trauma and its long-lasting effects. But it is so much more than that. It is a tale of family, of betrayal, of the things we do for love and what is done to us in love&amp;#39;s name. Marcia&amp;#39;s armour is dented in places, shattered in others, but with hope as her weapon, she fights for the life and love she deserves. Told with honesty and humour, this is a book I couldn&amp;#39;t put down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;~ Amanda J Spedding, two-time Australian Shadows Award winner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marcia pulled herself from the brink of self-extinction for one good reason &amp;ndash; she had a daughter. Funny thing is, she had never wanted to be a mother. She had borne the brunt of male brutality, yet she survived only to encounter further betrayals and losses.&amp;nbsp; And just when she thought she couldn&amp;rsquo;t go on, she did &amp;ndash; with wicked humour and a will to survive. This is a tough and tender ode to a heart and spirit that refused to shatter. A gift of hope to anyone who has ever wanted to give up and then tried again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;~ Joanne Fedler, Internationally bestselling author&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
