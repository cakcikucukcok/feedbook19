  <title>The People&#39;s Imaginative Revolution (Iran, 1979) - Jane Wood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jane Wood was a nurse from Britain, working abroad in 1979. Strangely, she happened to be in Iran when the country underwent a huge upheaval and revolution. The Shah left, a new government was overthrown, and fighting broke out, with shooting in the streets and a curfew imposed after dark. As time ticked away, Jane had to find a way out, back to home in England, looking for safety for herself and her family. It was a tense time, which she captures in words, poems and songs - some of which are still available today, mainly on YouTube. Jane reflects that it was an interesting time, and she feels as though she learned a lot. Share the drama with her." />
