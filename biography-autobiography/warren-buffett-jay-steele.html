  <title>Warren Buffett - Jay Steele</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Warren Buffett is known as the billionaire investment expert of the century and everyone would love to know the secret of his success. In his own words, Buffett is just a regular guy who likes fast food, honest work, and people he can trust. Throw in incredible instincts, a genius for numbers, meticulous research, and an almost sure-fire investment philosophy, and you begin to understand how he&#39;s become a legend in his own time. &lt;p&gt;With just a few thousands of dollars from relatives and friends, and by taking calculated risks with small companies and staying with them, he managed, almost single-handedly, to turn Salomon Brothers around. Giants like Disney, American Express, McDonald&#39;s, Gillette, and Coca-Cola have all been affected by Buffett&#39;s magic touch, and he owns a chunk of all of them. By thirty-one, BUffett had already made himself a millionaire, and he&#39;s worked his way steadily toward the top of the Forbes list. &lt;p&gt;Here is a fascinating portrait of Warren Buffett, known for his investigating genius, his sense of humor, and his mean turn of a phrase. It&#39;s an amazing story of a man who carved his own path through American business by doing his homework, backing companies he believed in, and growing rich on their success-a story that will show you that opportunity abounds for anyone willing to go for it." />
