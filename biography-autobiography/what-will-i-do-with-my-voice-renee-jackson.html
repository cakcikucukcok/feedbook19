This is a chance to show how life and the challenges that a young woman was faced with throughout her life. raised in a loving home with lots  of family around. This book  has been my dream. we will take a trip through the life of Bridgette Jones. Its true that the struggle gets real. I want to encourage people to stay in a mindful state of mind through each obstacle that your&#39;e faced with  it. I&#39;m not a teacher but I have a lot of experience, as we all do in, life skills that we learn along the way.  When things go wrong, you don&#39;t go with them!! because the bottom is over crowded. We together will learn that our thought have magnetic powers!!! Bridgette Jones will make her adventure through her life apart of yours!This book took years to complete , so know that nothing happens over night .during  this process while preparing my manuscript I was faced with a lot of character building days(bad days), I took a lot of losses financially, mentally,close friends and family members, INCLUDING MY ONE AND ONLY MOTHER, I&#39;ve  been homeless on and off , I was in a coma, fighting back against lupus,incarcerated for a crime that only they understand!! I DIDN&#39;T commit a crime that time!! I was being shut down so that I would study my life so that the rest of my days on earth will be full of joy!! I&#39;ve already experienced the feeling of pain, it&#39;s time to experience the FULL feeling of HAPPINESS AND SHARE WITH MY LOVE ONES that are still here with me. I am all over the place with my thoughts,my writings, my thinking, and my life.  all of this information that I been blessed with I felt compelled to reach out to my sister&#39;s and brothers and share with you all the journey through the eyes of a young black woman who took herself through alot of struggles on the fabulous side of things she overcame all of the challenges that she was faced with by having FAITH IN HER FATHER! Were there is adversity she learned to strap on her seat belt and let Jesus take the wheel and keep her in her lane!! This book will be the 1st of many yet to come!!
