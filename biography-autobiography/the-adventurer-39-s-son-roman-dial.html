He carried a light backpack and machete. Before he left,&amp;#160;Cody Roman Dial&amp;#160;emailed his father: &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;I am not sure how long it will take me, but I&amp;#8217;m planning on doing 4 days in the jungle and a day to walk out. I&amp;#8217;ll be bounded by a trail to the west and the coast everywhere else, so it should be difficult to get lost forever.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were the last words Dial received from his son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as he realized Cody Roman&amp;#8217;s return date had passed, Dial set off for Costa Rica. As he trekked through the dense jungle, interviewing locals and searching for clues&amp;#8212;the authorities suspected murder&amp;#8212;the desperate father was forced to confront the deepest questions about himself and his own role in the events. Roman had raised his son to be fearless, to be at home in earth&amp;#8217;s wildest places, travelling together through rugged Alaska to remote Borneo and Bhutan. Was he responsible for his son&amp;#8217;s fate? Or, as he hoped, was Cody Roman safe and using his wilderness skills on a solo adventure from which he would emerge at any moment?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part detective story set in the most beautiful yet dangerous reaches of the planet, &lt;em&gt;The Adventurer&amp;#8217;s Son&lt;/em&gt; emerges as a far deeper tale of discovery&amp;#8212;a journey to understand the truth about those we love the most.&amp;#160; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Adventurer&amp;#8217;s Son&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;includes fifty black-and-white photographs.&lt;/p&gt;" />
