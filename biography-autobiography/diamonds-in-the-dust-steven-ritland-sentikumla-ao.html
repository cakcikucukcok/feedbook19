  <title>Diamonds in the Dust - Steven Ritland, Sentikumla Ao</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 1991, Mrs. Sentikumla Ao (Sentila) had a vision and a strong sense of calling to work among drug addicts. After the vision, she asked God, Lord, what do you want me to do? The Lord said to go to drug addicts but that they would not be found in the church. Go to the places where they are. You will find them in houses where there is no guardian, among broken families, in favorite haunts where small groups gather. This was the start of Sentilas primary life ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn the methods and principles Sentila discovered to rescue miserable, abused, drug and alcohol users from their addictions. Let her heart of compassion touch your heart, and impart a new love for the precious souls that most people reject as unlovelythose that Sentila calls diamonds in the Dust. Read about the life experiences leading up to her call from Godhow they built the faith which sustained her through the tears, trials, and stigma of her labor with addicts, which many times tempted her to give up. Take a walk through the Nagaland hill country, retracing the steps of a pioneer missionary who braved the threat of trophy-hungry headhunters to carry the Gospel to primitive tribesmen in the mid-1800s.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While the book will appeal to readers with other interests and perspectives, it may be that someone struggling with an addiction will be able to find hope and a sense of self-worth through its pages.&lt;/p&gt;" />
