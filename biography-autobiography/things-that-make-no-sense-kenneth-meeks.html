  <title>Things That Make No Sense - Kenneth Meeks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Things That Make No Sense&lt;/i&gt; deals
with everyday occurrences
experienced by everyone as they go
about their daily lives. Some things
just dont make any sense at all!
Many of the stories included here
deal with common events such as
unresponsive or poor customer
service, which is becoming all
too frequent these days. Some of
these instances can probably be
characterized as funny, some as
unbelievable, and others as simply
irrational. Sometimes the only
appropriate reaction to one of these
annoying events is disgust.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Things That Make No Sense&lt;/i&gt; is
an entertaining and amusing
collection of sixty of the most
ridiculous of these actions and
decisions that author Kenneth W.
Meeks has observed. No doubt
everyone has had experiences
similar to those recounted hereor
even more unbelievable than
the ones included in the book.
Prepare to be sympathetically
irked, incredibly entertained, and
ridiculously amused!" />
