  <title>My Shard of Glass - David L. Dougherty</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We all possess snapshots in time in our hearts and mindsimages and memories that draw us back to our childhoods. In this collection of poetry and short stories, author David L. Dougherty combines whimsical make-believe with some truths about childhood experiences both tragic and lighthearted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dougherty recalls looking through the shard of glass from the kitchen door of his boyhood home. He shares a boys love for adventure and a mature mans appreciation of natures beauty. He also explores the heartfelt connection that he made while walking the sod of Ireland, the land of his ancestors, and standing at the ODougherty castle bridge in Buncrana, Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining whimsy and nostalgia, &lt;i&gt;My Shard of Glass&lt;/i&gt; offers an exploration in verse of nature, childhood, and times gone by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wish&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Two young boys, sitting on the bank,&lt;/br&gt;
watching the big rigs run.&lt;/br&gt;
One said, I wish we were old enough&lt;/br&gt;
for that kind of fun.&lt;/br&gt;
The driver saw the boys waving, and with a grin, said to his partner,&lt;/br&gt;
I wish we were on that bank again.&lt;/i&gt;" />
