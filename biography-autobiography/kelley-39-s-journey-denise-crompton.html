  <title>Kelley&#39;s Journey - Denise Crompton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Kelley has lived successfully for 39 years with a rare disease called Mucolipidosis III. It has affected all of her bones and joints, her trachea and bronchial tubes. Despite many surgical procedures, she has been a positive power of example to many. For such a young person, she has an incredible emotional strength. She and her family have a positive attitude toward her disability. When Kelley lacks motivation in school, it may well be that she is not feeling well, but is not making a fuss about it. She tunes in easily to other people, and is sensitive to their feelings and problems. Kelley is a concrete learner and has sound common sense. Although she has earned a Bachelor&#39;s degree in Psychology, her medical condition is so unpredictable that she is unable to work at a full time job. Despite an uncertain future, Kelley is an inspiration, consistently displaying a remarkable attitude while maintaining a strong faith in God; causing many people who know her to say, &#39;Kelley is my Hero!&#39;&lt;/p&gt;" />
