  <title>I Wouldn’T Have It Any Other Way - Samuel Myers Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When it comes to the final analysis, all of us has a story to tell. The problem is that to tell it takes a lot of will and patience. And when you think about it, willingness and patience are not some things that a lot of people have.
I titled this book I Wouldnt Have It Any Other Way. This title was not just chosen, there is a reason behind me coming up with this title. After reading this book, no doubt many are saying within yourselves, How in Gods world did he arrive at this title after having experienced all of the things that he has experienced?
When I look at my parents, siblings, and those that have shared many of the same experiences that I have, I decided to use all of these things as a stepping-stone, not as a stumbling block. I viewed these occurrences through the eyes of God. When I did, I said that I would not have it any other way.
All of the different things that I personally have been through have enabled me to draw closer to God. Having such an intimacy with God has caused me to get to places in Him that I never imagined.
I am mindful of the passage of scripture that is found in Romans 8:28. This scripture says that, And we know that all things work together for the good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.
This being said, I feel that all things that were mentioned in the content of this book, both the good and not so good, have happened for my betterment. These are the things from my days of my infancy to this present time.
With that being said, it was in the plan of God that I was born to Boston and Evelyn Myers. The things that they went through under the sharecropping system and the Jim Crow laws have helped me to value God and the things of God. The loss of my mother at an early age caused me to put my trust in God for my survival. The woodpile experience helped me to prepare for the establishment of a genuine relationship with God.
Lastly, the union with Mary Elizabeth was not an accident. This most definitely was in the plan of God. My three sons that came out from this union was also in the plan of God.
What can I say? I cannot say anything but that I Will Not Have It Any Other Way." />
