  <title>I Followed the Feathers and Found Myself - Jane McNally</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I Followed the Feathers and Found Myself is both an intimate, revealing autobiography and a practical self-help book in three parts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story is a true account of torment, fear, strength, and, eventually, hope. When Jane was young, she was visited by spirits in droves, which led to her being put into a psychiatric hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later the angels intervened, saved her from despair, and led her to true calling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Empowered by her sudden awakening and now a much respected and followed angel teacher and healer, Jane tells her story of seeing angels and spirits beyond this life and into the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn to raise your energy to that of angels and to trust spirit communication with tried and tested protection techniques taught by Jane in this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I visited Jane for healing found she was so tuned into me highly I recommend anyone to work with her, her powers are outstanding &lt;br /&gt;
Amanda Whitehouse&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jane has put her heart and soul into this account of her fascinating spiritual journey a great read for anyone intrested in Spirituality, Star children and the Angelic realms &lt;br /&gt;
