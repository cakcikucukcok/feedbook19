  <title>Whose Life is it Anyway? - Deborah Thomson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Deborah Thomson met Wayne, she was a shy, introverted 24-year-old student. He was a loud charismatic young man.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;His temper was an issue but one she hoped they could work on. Four years later, the married couple now ran a business together, and their first child was born.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yet, any dreams of peaceful family life were quickly crushed by Wayne&#39;s increasingly violent and controlling behaviour.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Life turned into a cycle of hope, fear and pain, and her marriage into a prison from which there was no escaping.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It lasted 17 years.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Based on the journals the author kept throughout the ordeal, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Whose Life Is It Anyway&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is a chilling memoir of her agonising years living and working with her abuser.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;A powerful, frightening story, highlighting a world I do not understand, fortunately a world the author has escaped from.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt; - Ian Waller, Burnie, Tasmania" />
