  <title>Living with a Headache - Pedro Miguel Guerreiro Filipe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="MY THOUGHTS
No matter if you lose the strength to fight in life, just think that the people who make fun of you like it when
youre weak. Just ignore them and walk away, and that will make them weaker than you feel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You cant choose what life throws at you, but you can dodge some of it if you do not want it to stick to you. Even though you cant control what life brings, just be patient and good will come out of that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I know it hurts to be teased, but it hurts them more if you dont say a word. Even if you do not have control of the suffering that life throws at you, it is not worth taking your life because it might make the people who love you sad, and no one deserves to be sad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It really hurts to be teased. Just remember God will deal with those who hurt you the most; maybe not in this life, but they will get their turn. Try not to hurt others. If you have got hurt, you know how it aches." />
