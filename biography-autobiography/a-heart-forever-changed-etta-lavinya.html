  <title>A Heart Forever Changed - Etta LaVinya</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Between the 1940s and the 1960s,
rheumatic fever was a leading cause
of death in children. If they survived,
there would most likely be some lasting
damage, particularly to the heart.
This is Etta LaVinyas story of being
one of those children who, at age 5, was
diagnosed with scarlet fever. Scarlet
fever is contracted first by a germ called
group A streptococcus, or strep throat.
If scarlet fever isnt completely cured,
then rheumatic fever develops.
In the 1990s, Etta found out, while
getting a checkup, that she had a mitral
valve prolapse (a heart valve that doesnt
close properly) most likely caused by
rheumatic fever. In 1965, Ettas parents
werent aware that she wasnt cured from
the scarlet fever and had developed
rheumatic fever. Her doctor informed
her that the mitral valve prolapse wasnt
anything to worry about, but she would
need to take antibiotics before any
dental procedures, or any other invasive
procedures she underwent in the
future to prevent her from contracting
bacterial endocarditis. She followed
those instructions for years, and had no
problems until 2007.
In the year 2000, Etta was married for
the first time. The marriage was a rocky
and confusing union for her, and after
5 years she realized she was married to
an abusive man. During those years of
verbal, mental and emotional abuse
the stress it caused is what Etta believes
landed her in the hospital in 2007
fighting for her life.
This is Etta LaVinyas story of surviving
a very serious illness, two open heart
surgeries and more, brought on by
extreme stress. She has written her story
with the hope that it will bring strength
and courage to those who may be
experiencing serious illness, open heart
surgery or domestic violence." />
