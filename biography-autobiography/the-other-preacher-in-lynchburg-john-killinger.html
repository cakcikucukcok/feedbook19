  <title>The Other Preacher in Lynchburg - John Killinger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After teaching for a number of years, John Killinger, eager to be a pastor, was offered a church in Lynchburg, Virginia. It was in the 1980s when Jerry Falwell had a congregation there. Falwell had just started the Moral Majority movement and had helped to get Ronald Reagan elected president. In 1983, a Good Housekeeping national poll rated Jerry Falwell the second most respected man in America after Reagan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Killinger&#39;s new book is in part a picture of Falwell and an exploration of his influence from the unique standpoint of a &quot;rival&quot; minister who says that his experience of his Lynchburg years is what soon turned him into one of Fundamentalism&#39;s most trenchant and outspoken critics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a fascinating story told with great grace and style about two very different men of faith, both struggling to capture hearts, minds, and souls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Swift-moving and engaging.&quot; - &lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
