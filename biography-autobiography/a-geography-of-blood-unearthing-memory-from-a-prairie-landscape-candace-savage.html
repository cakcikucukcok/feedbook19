  <title>A Geography of Blood: Unearthing Memory from a Prairie Landscape - Candace Savage</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&amp;bull;&lt;B&gt;Finalist, Hilary Weston Writers&amp;#8217; Trust Prize for Non-Fiction&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When &lt;B&gt;Candace Savage&lt;/B&gt; and her partner buy a house in the romantic little town of Eastend, she has no idea what awaits her. At first she enjoys exploring the area around their new home, including the boyhood haunts of the celebrated American writer Wallace Stegner, the back roads of the Cypress Hills, the dinosaur skeletons at the T.Rex Discovery Centre, the fossils to be found in the dust-dry hills. She also revels in her encounters with the wild inhabitants of this mysterious land-three coyotes in a ditch at night, their eyes glinting in the dark; a deer at the window; a cougar pussy-footing it through a gully a few minutes&#39; walk from town.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;br&gt;But as Savage explores further, she uncovers a darker reality-a story of cruelty and survival set in the still-recent past--and finds that she must reassess the story she grew up with as the daughter, granddaughter, and great-granddaughter of prairie homesteaders.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beautifully written, impeccably researched, and imbued with Savage&#39;s passion for this place, &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;A Geography of Blood&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; offers both a shocking new version of plains history and an unforgettable portrait of the windswept, shining country of the Cypress Hills.&lt;/div&gt;" />
