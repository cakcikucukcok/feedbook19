  <title>Stephen Donald - Beaver - Scotty Stevenson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Stephen Donald etched himself into All Blacks folklore with that &#39;kick&#39; in the 2011 Rugby World Cup final at Eden Park. Donald, one of the country&#39;s most popular All Blacks, had not originally been wanted for the World Cup squad. He was whitebaiting in the Waikato and effectively off the rugby grid when the SOS went out for his services. The rest, as they say, is history. That one penalty goal in the final has ensured him a special place in All Blacks history. Now, Donald is combining with the hugely talented rugby writer and commentator Scotty &#39;Sumo&#39; Stevenson in a book which will cover not only Donald&#39;s sporting career and his part in the All Blacks&#39; historic Cup win, but also poke the borax at both himself and his team mates. Stevenson&#39;s unique brand of humour - he collaborated with Cory Jane on the screaming funny Cory Jane: Winging It - will ensure Beaver&#39;s book will be one to be both remembered and most feared (especially if you&#39;re a high profile teammate!)&lt;/p&gt;" />
