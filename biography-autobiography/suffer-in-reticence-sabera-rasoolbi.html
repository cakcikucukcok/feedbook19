  <title>Suffer in Reticence - Sabera Rasoolbi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Her writing should be an inspiration and a lesson to others who are going through what she suffered and experienced. She was lucky enough to overcome her obstacles by following the advice of both her late loving father and one of the late great Muslim Scholars (May Allah grant them both paradise). Some people will probably learn something about how to get over their hindrances by following the steps she took and hope her practice of her Muslim religion will be of help as it did to her until now and hopefully until she dies. She truly loves, believes and practices what her God and His last prophet, peace be upon him (pbuh), the only perfect man who has ever lived on earth and by putting into practice his teachings and his sayings and also by following her God`s commands in His Holy Qur`an religiously, she succeeded in enjoying her inner peace and happiness. Most of all, by believing and putting all her trust in Her Creator, Allah or God, she gained guidance and was put into the straight path. If anyone follows the same procedures she put into practice, which was to love Allah and His last prophet Mohammad (pbuh) more than herself, and anyone or anything else on earth only then guidance and Allah will put that person into His Right Path, Islam. Islam is way of life from cradle to death. Islam means peace. That is when one enjoys inner peace and happiness as the author of this book. Only by doing so, the reader will understand and experience what she did InshaAllah, God`s Willing. She overcame any hindrances presenting in her life. Simply by supplicating and worshipping only Her Creator, Allah alone without any partnership. Allah is the One who has the solutions of all the problems. To Him we come from and to Him we will return. Therefore, to Him alone she is thankful for the wishes He has granted her and also she is more grateful for those He has denied her because He knows best. For this reason, a Muslim must always say, `Alhamdulliilah`, praised be to Allah whether good or bad. One must be patient as the name appears in her writings, Sabera, meaning patient." />
