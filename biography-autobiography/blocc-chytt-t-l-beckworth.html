  <title>Blocc Chytt - T.L. Beckworth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Three brothers, same mother and same father, all riding for the same cause and are very loyal to one another.  Gang banging is what they do to the fullest and respect is what they&#39;ve earned. Hustling is a way of life and the women come with the territory.  
The middle brother, Young Duece, is the most hated, the most loved, and the most feared in the Denver city streets. He fears no one, but he doesn&#39;t let it go to his head.  The ones that despise him the most are the ones that are within his blocc. Some of his so called homeboys even want him dead and will stop at nothing to lay him down.
Is Young Deuce ready for the unexpected or will he simply be caught off guard? Anything goes when you live and thrive on this BLOCC CHYTT!" />
