  <title>Nobody Walks - Dennis M. Walsh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In the vein of &lt;i&gt;The Boondock Saints&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Chinatown&lt;/i&gt; comes this true crime memoir of brotherly love and vengeance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;In 2003, Christopher Walsh was found stuffed in a trash barrel in a storage locker in Van Nuys, California. After the dilatory murder investigation took seven months to file charges, and years to go to trial, Dennis Walsh knew it was up to him to keep his little brother&#39;s murder from becoming a cold case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only son of a large Irish-American family to stay on the straight and narrow, Dennis found his family&#39;s dubious background paired with his law degree placed him in the unique position to finish the job the cops couldn&#39;t. Fencing with the police and the DA&#39;s office, Dennis spent years slinking between his life as a stand-up lawyer and hitting the streets to try and convince the dopers, thieves, prostitutes, porn stars, and jail birds that populated Christopher&#39;s world to come forward and cooperate with the police. Yet he walked a fine line with his harsh tactics; prosecutors continuously told him he was jeopardizing not only the case, but his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staying on the right side of the law to hunt down these murderers put every part of Dennis to the test and it wasn&#39;t long before the brother who went clean knew he&#39;d have to get his hands dirty. But 100 arrests later, the murderers are in jail for life. With the gravity of a Scorsese film, this classic yet gritty tale transcends the true crime genre. &lt;i&gt;Nobody Walks&lt;/i&gt; is the harrowing story of a family, brothers, and the true meaning of justice.&lt;/p&gt;" />
