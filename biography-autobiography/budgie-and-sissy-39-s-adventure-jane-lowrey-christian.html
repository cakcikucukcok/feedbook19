  <title>Budgie and Sissy&#39;s Adventure - Jane Lowrey-Christian</title>
      <meta name="description" content="True incidents and memories from the viewpoint of the author, as a small girl in North Missouri, on a farm, along with her brothers and the influence her parents and grandparents played in their lives.  All ages will enjoy reading the interactions of Budgie and Sissy as they struggle with decisions and lessons learned and react to each situation only as children can.  The stories took place during the Depression and drought in the 1930s. 
	 The author is the only living member of her family mentioned in these pages and would not have had the courage to write these words as she remembers them, if they were here looking over her shoulder. She was very shy as a child and would have been embarrassed to have her family know her true feelings. This book expresses her love as a child for her family and the love she feels now as an adult when they are in her memories." />
