  <title>Beyond Trail’S End - Dorothy Baxter Arquette, Judy Arquette Brassard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the early twentieth century, a young man left his northeastern farm in search of a new beginning. With a few possessions and a one-way ticket, Delbert Baxter rode as far west as the train could take him. As he reached the end of the line, Baxter began an unforgettable adventure that would lead him through Montana, Canada, the Rocky Mountains, and eventually to Northern British Columbia. This is the heartwarming story of a true wilderness survivor, homesteader, and mountain man. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In BEYOND TRAILS END, Dorothy Baxter Arquette and Judy Arquette Brassard chronicle their ancestors fascinating journey as he set out on the adventure of a lifetime. After working for nine years on ranches in Montana and logging camps in the Rocky Mountains, and later settling a homestead on the prairie in Alberta, Baxter eventually lands in British Columbia, where he becomes a fur trapper and trader in Peace River County. As he hunts, fishes, and lives off the land, Baxter learns how to survive in the desolate wilderness. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;BEYOND TRAILS END documents beloved family stories for generations to come and forever preserves a time in a young adventurers life when he took a chance and made wonderful memories in the process.&lt;/p&gt;" />
