  <title>The Man of the Cloth - Ruth Ann Lambe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="First of all, I am highly honored to pen this biographical sketch of my favorite preacher, visionary, businessman, mentor, and leadera genuine man of the cloth, my husband. We are often told that we are in control of our own destiny for our lives, and this often helps to empower us to make key decisions in the situations that we face on our journey throughout life. It may seem at times that we are constantly faced with oppositions, which challenge us to either make us or break us. Yet at some point, it seems that doors miraculously open, and we are faced with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. At that point, we begin to realize that there is a whole lot more to life than we may have previously considered, and we reflect on the providence of God to direct us to His ultimate destiny through His divine plan for our lives. 
The development of a leader by God is a progressive (unique refining) process that can, at times, leave you feeling as if you are all alone. However, you continue to develop a relationship with God and sense His divine intervention gently shifting circumstances and honing into your development of gifts, talents, and abilities. Remarkably, your life is transformed, and you realize that you are no longer alone. 
This is a journey of a son of the soil. He was born in poverty, raised through hardship and rejection, and yet was groomed for a divine destiny as a man of the cloth. Who would have guessed all that God had in store? This biography will provide for you a few details of the journey, the process and spiritual enrichment of Gods anointed mouthpiece, and the significant impact of his days on this terrestrial globe." />
