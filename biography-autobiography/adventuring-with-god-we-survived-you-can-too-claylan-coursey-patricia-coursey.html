  <title>Adventuring with God We Survived—You Can Too - Claylan Coursey, Patricia Coursey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The greatest opportunity one has is to go on a venture with someone important. The Courseys went on an adventure with God as he called them into a special task with him. He performed wonders as he led them toward the fulfillment of the task he assigned them. They have written fifteen true life stories, mostly of Kenya, of different events that occurred along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all the situations were fun filled at the time, but with them in the rearview mirror, the Courseys enjoy laughing about them. There were troubles on the road and at home, in floods and dry times, by slithery creatures as well as by two-legged and four-legged creatures, and there were times of good health and times of health concerns. Some of these could have turned into quite bad situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Courseys look back, they can enjoy and laugh at many of the situations with their children and friends and appreciate the ways by which the Lord brought them through each one. They desire to share some of them with you. They recommend that everyone follow God wherever he leads them and, in doing this experience, the best life possible. God brought the Courseys home. He will also bring you home as you venture with him.&lt;/p&gt;" />
