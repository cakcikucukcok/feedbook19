  <title>Hitler&#39;s Last Day: Minute by Minute - Emma Craigie, Jonathan Mayo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;On 30th April 1945 the world is in chaos...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;American and Russian forces have linked up in the middle of Germany, but the fighting continues. The roads of Germany are full of people &amp;#150; Jews who have survived concentration camps, Allied POWs trying to get home, and Nazis on the run. The civilian population under German control will run out of food in less than a fortnight. The man whose dream of a thousand-year Reich began this nightmare is in a bunker beneath the streets of Berlin saying his farewells. By 4pm he will be dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hitler&amp;#8217;s Last Day: Minute by Minute&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, is pure chronological narrative, as seen through the eyes of those who were there in the bunker, those fighting in the streets of Germany, and those pacing the corridors of power in Washington, London and Moscow. It was a day of endings and beginnings when ordinary people were placed often in extraordinary situations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take Sisi Wilczek, fleeing the advancing Russians with her family&amp;#8217;s vast fortune in a shoebox; President Truman, weighing up using the atomic bomb that his Secretary of War calls &amp;#145;the most terrible weapon ever known in human history&amp;#8217;; German officer Claus Sellier, on a last mission across the country to deliver vital documents; or Allied aircrews dropping food parcels instead of bombs to feed the starving Dutch population.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;30th April 1945 was a day that millions had dreamed of, and died for...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
