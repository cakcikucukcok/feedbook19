  <title>Acm, My Other Man - Sue Fone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The postcard read, Dont write no more, I may get a new address. Love U. ACM
&lt;p&gt;
Alfred Clay Moore planned and carried out his suicide.&lt;br&gt;
He needed answers to questions before he could leave, and it was his unaware best friend he turned to.&lt;br&gt;
This is a love story between a young emergency room nurse and her aide, a self-taught man from the hollers of West Virginia, fifteen years older.&lt;br&gt;
The story spans twenty years of their friendship: the games they played, the talks they had and the lessons they learned from each other. This is a heartfelt, poignant tale of a most unique relationship where role of teacher and student continually shifts from one to the other.&lt;br&gt;
Although often touched by death in her profession, when she lost ACM, her other man, she had no coping skills for her own grief; she was empty for months.&lt;br&gt;
In an effort to stay connected and able to feel him, she pulled out years of letters and pieced them together by date. Then with her morning coffee she re-read his words and traveled backward remembering, reliving and holding on to every moment she could.&lt;br&gt;
Finally she understood the urgency of his need to feel completely secure and why he needed to know the answer to, what would happen if&lt;br&gt;
ACM, MY OTHER MAN pulls emotions from the heart, soul and mind. Its funny, sad, even a little bit crazy, but very real to a West Virginia Hillbilly and his nurse.&lt;br&gt;
This is one womans story of dealing with goodbye and a book for anyone who has ever lost a friend.&lt;br&gt;
If you liked Tuesdays with Morrie and Ghost, youll love ACM, MY OTHER MAN.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&quot;A warm, heart-felt story of a different kind of love between two of the most unlikely people you will ever meet. You&#39;ll laugh, you&#39;ll cry, and you&#39;ll think about all the weirdo&#39;s in your life that you&#39;ve met along the way.&lt;br&gt;
Once you start the book it will be hard to put down.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
