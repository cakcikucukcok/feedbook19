  <title>My Black Family, My White Privilege - Michael R. Wenger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 1970, a working-class, Jewish man from New York City married an African American woman from rural, segregated North Carolina. From their union, &lt;i&gt;Michael Wenger&lt;/i&gt; has three children, four grandchildren, and one great grandchild. Years later, &lt;i&gt;Mr. Wenger&lt;/i&gt; served as Deputy Director for Outreach and Program Development for President Clintons Initiative on Race, an opportunity that confirmed for him the conscious and unconscious bias that people of color confront daily in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both personally and professionally, &lt;i&gt;Mr. Wenger&lt;/i&gt; has peered into a world far beyond the comprehension of most white people in our society. His book, deeply moving and tenderly written, shares the discoveries hes made. He masterfully weaves his personal and professional journeys and helps readers of all races to become more aware of the pain that well-meaning white Americans inflict on people of color, often without knowing it, and to recognize the richness that awaits those with the courage to embrace our nations growing diversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mr. Wengers&lt;/i&gt; remarkable and inspirational story will, at times, move you to tears while occasionally triggering a knowing laugh as he recounts the struggles and triumphs of his journey. It will awaken you to the stark realities of life for some in America today, while fostering hope for and a commitment to a more racially equitable and harmonious future for all.&lt;/p&gt;" />
