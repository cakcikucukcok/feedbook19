  <title>Derailed - Jerry Tanner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Derailed is the saga of a highly successful businessman brought down by mere allegations of misconduct, his subsequent confrontation with an American legal system that categorically denied him a fair trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A natural entrepreneur, Jerry started a $20 million dollar health care company from scratch, then took over a corrupt, bankrupt mail order pharmacy and within one year turned it into a $30 million dollar company. And all of that would have been just the beginning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when Jerry found himself entangled in a legal battle over allegations of sexual assault brought by the sons of an evangelical pastor in one of the cradles of the religious right, it all came crashing down. As a gay man highly successful in business, Jerry did not fit the moralist model of the prevailing community. In short, he wasnt supposed to be successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book details Jerrys early life, the rapid rise of his successful healthcare companies, and the fall that came with the criminal indictment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derailed is a powerful commentary on the hypocrisy of an American society founded on the principles of equality and tolerance, yet steeped in institutionalized prejudice, and a stinging indictment of our system of courts and jurisprudence.&lt;/p&gt;" />
