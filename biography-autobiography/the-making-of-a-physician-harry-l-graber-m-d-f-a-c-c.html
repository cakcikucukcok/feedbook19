  <title>The Making of a Physician - Harry L. Graber M.D. F.A.C.C.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Both genetic and environmental factors play important roles in ones life. Genetics remains a fixed entity, whereas environment is a variable. Environmental experiences in life can have a positive or negative influence upon the genetic makeup of a given individual. Decision-making in the preschool environment is predominantly controlled by parents. Eventually, the individual, being influenced by the many past environmental factors, becomes the responsible choice maker as to which path in life he/she wishes to travel. It is my belief that it is providential that one is given these experiences to aid in our decision-making. This concept was supported by five of the physicians who shared their stories (chapter 10). All were greatly influenced by role models whom they encountered in their earlier life. This influence factor is not a single event, but a continuum. This forms the basis of the concept that the making of a physician is not a one-time event but represents a continuum. For some of us, becoming a physician was understood as a calling.
The stories in this book were shared so that others may develop a greater appreciation of their own environmental experiences and consider them as influential factors in the decision-making of their lives. It is also my hope that this book might be of positive help to the young person considering the medical profession as his or her vocation." />
