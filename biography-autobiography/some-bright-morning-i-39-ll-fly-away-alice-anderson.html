  <title>Some Bright Morning, I&#39;ll Fly Away - Alice Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The incredible true story of one woman&#39;s journey to relocate the place inside herself where strength, hope, and personal truth reside.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Hurricane Katrina, Alice Anderson has returned home to assess the damage to her beloved Mississippi coastline and the once-immaculate home she&#39;d carefully cultivated for her husband, Dr. Liam Rivers, one of the community&#39;s highly respected doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in the wake of this natural disaster, a more terrifying challenge emerges as Liam&#39;s mental health spirals out of control, culminating in a violent attack at knifepoint, from which Alice is saved by their three-year-old son. Afraid for her life, she flees with her children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What ensues is an epic battle--emotional, psychological, spiritual, and legal--for her children&#39;s welfare, for self-preservation, and ultimately for redemption. It&#39;s an unrelenting battle that persists even as life goes on, finally coming full circle when the same son who saved Alice ten years before endures an eerily-familiar violent encounter at his father&#39;s hands. Yet even as she confronts the harsh realities of high-powered Southern lawyers and an inadequate legal system, Alice forges a new life with her blossoming children and an ultimate reclamation of her true self.&lt;/p&gt;" />
