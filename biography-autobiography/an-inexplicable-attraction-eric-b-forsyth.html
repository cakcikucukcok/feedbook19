  <title>An Inexplicable Attraction - Eric B. Forsyth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sailing well into his eighties, Captain Eric Forsyth shows in his book,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Inexplicable Attraction: My Fifty Years of Ocean Sailing,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;that age need not be a barrier to an adventurous&amp;nbsp;retirement. His love of ocean sailing was ignited in 1964 when he crossed the Atlantic with his wife, Edith,&amp;nbsp;crewing aboard a friend&amp;rsquo;s 46-foot boat. For more than fifty years, mostly aboard his sturdy cutter&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;Fiona&lt;/em&gt;, Forsyth&amp;nbsp;has cruised the oceans of the world, making voyages that included two circumnavigations of the globe, cruises&amp;nbsp;through the Northwest Passage and to the Baltic, and several excursions to both the Arctic and Antarctic. His&amp;nbsp;stories will appeal to all sailors, whether active or armchair, and to travel buffs with a penchant for remote&amp;nbsp;places and their histories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a more serious side, Forsyth has seen many countries that he visited over the decades change from&lt;br /&gt;
languorous oligarchies to developing democracies with a thriving middle class. Like the U.S., they have a&lt;br /&gt;
profligate appetite for fossil fuel, which is not a sustainable resource in the long run. He suggests ways of&lt;br /&gt;
bringing attention to this global problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Captain Forsyth has been honored by fellow sailors with the Seven Seas Award from the Seven Seas Cruising&lt;br /&gt;
Association, and the Blue Water Medal, given annually by the Cruising Club of America to a single amateur&lt;br /&gt;
sailor worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;" />
