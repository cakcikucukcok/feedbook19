  <title>Jasmine and Stars - Fatemeh Keshavarz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In a direct, frank, and intimate exploration of Iranian literature and society, scholar, teacher, and poet Fatemeh Keshavarz challenges popular perceptions of Iran as a society bereft of vitality and joy. Her fresh perspective on present-day Iran provides a rare insight into this rich culture alive with artistic expression but virtually unknown to most Americans. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keshavarz introduces readers to two modern Iranian women writers whose strong and articulate voices belie the stereotypical perception of Iranian women as voiceless victims in a country of villains. She follows with a lively critique of the recent best-seller &lt;i&gt;Reading Lolita in Tehran: A Memoir in Books&lt;/i&gt;, which epitomizes what Keshavarz calls the &quot;New Orientalist narrative,&quot; a view marred by stereotype and prejudice more often tied to current geopolitical conflicts than to an understanding of Iran. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blending in firsthand glimpses of her own life--from childhood memories in 1960s Shiraz to her present life as a professor in America--Keshavarz paints a portrait of Iran depicting both cultural depth and intellectual complexity. With a scholar&#39;s expertise and a poet&#39;s hand, she helps amplify the powerful voices of contemporary Iranians and leads readers toward a deeper understanding of the country&#39;s past and present.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;!--for pb reprint:&lt;br/&gt;In a direct, frank, and intimate exploration of Iranian literature and society, scholar, teacher, and poet Fatemeh Keshavarz challenges popular perceptions of Iran as a society bereft of vitality and joy.
