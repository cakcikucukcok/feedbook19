  <title>Krzysztof Kieslowski - Renata Bernard, Steven Woodward</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Krzysztof Kieslowski&amp;#8217;s untimely death came at the height of his career, after his &lt;i&gt;Three Colors&lt;/i&gt; trilogy of films garnered international acclaim (and an Oscar nomination), and he had been proclaimed Europe&amp;#8217;s most important filmmaker by many critics. Born in 1941, he was only fifty-four years old when he died.&lt;p&gt;Kieslowski himself tried to tell the story of his life and career in the 1993 book &lt;i&gt;Kieslowski on Kieslowski&lt;/i&gt;. This collection, by contrast, reveals the shifting voice of a filmmaker who was initially optimistic about his social and cultural role, then felt himself buffeted by the turbulent politics and events of the People&amp;#8217;s Republic of Poland. As described in the chronology in this book, he found himself subject to the &amp;#8220;economic censorship&amp;#8221; of post-Communist filmmaking.&lt;p&gt;How Kieslowski responded at each moment of his life, what he tried to achieve with each of his films, is finely detailed in thirty-five selections. These pieces bring together his thesis from the famous Lodz film school, a manifesto written just before the dark days of martial law in Poland, diary entries from the first time he was working outside Poland, and numerous rare interviews from Polish-, French-, and English-language sources.&lt;/p&gt;" />
