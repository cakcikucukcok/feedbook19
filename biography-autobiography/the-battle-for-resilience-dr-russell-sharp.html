  <title>The Battle for Resilience - Dr. Russell Sharp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;You are in the middle of a battle. We are all fighting to live the best and most resilient life we can.&lt;br /&gt;
Unique circumstances create unique understandings about our lives. I went undercover in the British Army to&lt;br /&gt;
investigate bullying for the BBC. This book follows the pre to post undercover story through experiences of being a&lt;br /&gt;
soldier in training, working for a large media co-operation and being the face of a controversial prime time programme. It documents these events and captures reflections and conversations about them over the last decade, adding related and accessible psychology as a golden thread. This highlights what supports and hinders our wellbeing in everyday modern life and touches on current topics such as use of social media, body image, identity, motivation, job satisfaction and fame to name but a few. 24 hours undercover in the British Army investigating bullying: 0400 hours: In camouflaged combat uniform, I blend into a dark, wet, cold field in the&lt;br /&gt;
middle of Yorkshire, gripping a rifle. On my bag, my name and number: Private Sharp: 30037286. It contains everything I need to survive a week outdoors. A small sugary sweet provides a morale boost and the sun rise gives a glimmer of hope and reminder of the natural wonder of the world that we are lucky to be part of, despite our hardships. 1200 hours: A grey floor in a bland accommodation block in Army barracks, surrounded by dismantled rifle parts, I clean every last bit of mud, dirt and carbon. Recruits share banter until we are ordered to be quiet. The relationships built over adverse circumstance are some of the strongest. My mobile phone and hidden cameras wait silently in my pockets as I listen intently for signs of wrong doing and anything that disrupts the wellbeing of these people. 2000 Hours: Lively night time in bustling Oxford Street, London. I scan the horizon and see the bright flashing lights and blur of people going about their lives. I walk among the crowds having brought video footage of a recruit&amp;rsquo;s testimony about an alleged assault in Army training. Following a hushed de-brief in a secure BBC office, it&amp;rsquo;s time for some fleeting freedom among people celebrating the night life. Through the secretive, isolating, physically enduring experiences, I emerged a different man. I hope sharing this story and these experiences with related psychological discussion can help you develop a new way of thinking about resilience and motivation in your life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
