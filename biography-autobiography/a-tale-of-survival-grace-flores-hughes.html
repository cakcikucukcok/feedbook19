  <title>A Tale of Survival - Grace Flores-Hughes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Tale of Survival is an explosive story that is much more than a simple memoir of an Hispanic woman: it is an important, quintessential American story of adversity and perseverance. This is a brutally honest and provocative tale of not merely survival but success from one who came from a time and place where success and upward mobility for a Mexican-American was not only unlikely but damn near impossible. Unlike some other Hispanic memoirs, Grace Flores-Hughes describes her childhood and transition to adulthood and beyond, against the tapestry of the modern Hispanic experience and the sometimes turbulent era of the rebellious baby-boomer generation. She writes of assimilation, racial and ethnic injustice, her role in coining of the term Hispanic, and her championing the lives of the disenfranchised before and after the civil rights movement. Further, Ms. Flores- Hughes takes you on this treacherous journey while exploring her encounters and friendships with many of Americas leaders. She demonstrates in this colorful and spicy story that Hold the Salsa has never been her style; a story that chronicles the emergence of a childs identity to that of an accomplished Hispanic woman who rose against all odds." />
