  <title>The Reverse Is True - George Gachara</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;The Reverse Is True&lt;/I&gt; is a semi - autobiographical collection of essays, personal reflection stories and life experiences; the life journey of a boy growing up to become a man.
&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;The author invites you to follow him through his journey in order for you to understand the influences in his life. At a tender age, the author is wounded by the death of his single mother and he begins the quest to find himself, a place to belong and a place in society. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;This quest sends him into a journey of discovery about learning, masculinity, patriotism, his notions of success as well as how to deal with the experience of feeling lost &lt;I&gt;within &lt;/I&gt;oneself.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The author&#39;s sense of fun, determination and zest for life is shown in his quest to find his way, to locate himself and his bearings in a land to which he belongs. Through his reflections, the author hopes to inspire the asking of critical questions about contemporary influences and culture. He hopes to cause a revolutionary awakening of conscience, which should reshape our thinking and transform our hearts and lives.&lt;/P&gt;" />
