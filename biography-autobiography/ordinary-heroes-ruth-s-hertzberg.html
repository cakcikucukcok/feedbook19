  <title>Ordinary Heroes - Ruth S. Hertzberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This brief book tell about the lives of two participants in World War II, Abraham and Isidore Hertzberg and their lives after they returned from this conflagration. There fore it is both a bona fide account of combat plus a family history. There are some unbelievable  incidents in this account. If it were not for the navigational knowledge of Abraham Hertzberg, he might not have even made it to his base in England.  Isidore Hertzberg might have fought in the Battle of the Bulge, if the Germans had been stronger.  The lives of these brothers after the war is unremarkable, except that Abraham became a very successful Civil engineer and Architect, and Isadore, while working as a carpenter sired a fine family who have far exceeded his own academic achievements.  This book surveys the lives of both ordinary and extraordinary people and is a reflection of  life in the United States in the second half of the 20th century." />
