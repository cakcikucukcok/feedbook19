  <title>Topspin - Eliot Berry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Author of the acclaimed &lt;i&gt;Tough Draw (&lt;/i&gt;which Arthur Ashe called &quot;one of the best books on professional tennis I&#39;ve ever read&quot;), Eliot Berry returns to the graceful, high-stakes game of world-class tennis to share his insights on what it takes to be a winner. Berry follows today&#39;s top players, as well as a select few juniors on the rise, through the major worldwide tournaments on all surfaces--from the clay courts of the Orange Bowl to the grass of Wimbledon to the hardcourts of the U.S. Open and beyond. The author&#39;s talent for finding the most exciting battles, often far from the glare of center court, is evident in gripping play-by-play descriptions. Berry also reexamines yesterday&#39;s stars--Rod Laver, Ken Rosewall, Roy Emerson, John McEnroe, Martina Navratilova, and other greats of the game, including a fascinating portrait of the late Fred Perry that stands as a poignant testament to a vanished era. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eliot Berry, dubbed &quot;a jock with a brain&quot; by &lt;i&gt;Inside Tennis&lt;/i&gt; magazine, views the sport within the context of its unique history to show why certain athletes succeed, how to identify tomorrow&#39;s winners, and why time at the top is fleeting, even for today&#39;s greatest champions. The author&#39;s trademark blend of insightful interviews and vivid courtside commentary opens the door to a world most tennis enthusiasts can never enter; his privileged access to the stars and their coaches and families--earned through the critical success of &lt;i&gt;Tough Draw--&lt;/i&gt;yields a rare glimpse of world-class professional tennis as it is really lived and played. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Topspin&lt;/i&gt; is a stunning tribute to the game, its past masters and present stars--a book for all tennis fans and players.&lt;/p&gt;" />
