  <title>American Odyssey - Wilhelm Reich, Mary Boyd Higgins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A new autobiographical work by one of the most original and controversial thinkers of our time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I looked up every day from behind the bars to the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor. Her light shone brightly into a dark night.&quot; With these words, Wilhelm Reich described his experience as an &quot;enemy alien&quot; imprisoned on Ellis Island in the aftermath of the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;American Odyssey&lt;/i&gt;, compiled from his correspondence and journals, chronicles Reich&#39;s first years in America. They were years of prodigious accomplishment in which he developed the orgone energy accumulator-the so-called orgone box; published his first books in English; made breakthroughs in his investigation of orgone energy in social pathology, physics, astronomy, and cancer; and interested none other than Albert Einstein in testing his theories. America brought a new marriage, a new son, a new group of students, and a new laboratory. But these were years of fierce struggle as well: the denial of an American medical license, the refusal of a patent on the orgone accumulator, and, finally, a slanderous article that would incite the Food and Drug Administration to the dogged attack on Reich that would continue until his death in another prison cell ten years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;American Odyssey&lt;/i&gt; reveals more than a period in the life of an embattled scientist. It discloses the social and intellectual life of a country in a tumultuous time in history.&lt;/p&gt;" />
