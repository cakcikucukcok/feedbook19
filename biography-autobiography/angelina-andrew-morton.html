  <title>Angelina - Andrew Morton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The gripping true story of Angelina Jolie, from #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling biographer Andrew Morton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I like to collect knives,&quot; says Angelina Jolie, &quot;but I also collect first edition books.&quot; At first glance, she might seem to be someone without any secrets, talking openly about her love life, sexual preferences, drug use, cutting, and tattoos--and why she kissed her brother on the lips in public. And yet mysteries remain: What was really going on in her brief, impulsive marriages to Jonny Lee Miller and Billy Bob Thornton, and what was going on in her partnership with Brad Pitt? What&#39;s behind the oft-reported feud with her father, the Oscar-winning actor Jon Voight?  What drove her to become a mother of six children in six years? And--perhaps most puzzling of all--what about the other side of Angelina: How did this talented but troubled young actress, barely 35 years old, become a respected Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations as well as the &quot;most powerful celebrity in the world&quot; (unseating Oprah Winfrey) on &lt;i&gt;Forbes&#39;&lt;/i&gt; 2009 Celebrity 100 list?  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answers that Andrew Morton has uncovered are astonishing, taking us deep inside Angelina&#39;s world to show us what shaped her as a child, as an actress, and as a woman struggling to overcome personal demons that have never before been revealed. In this spellbinding biography, Andrew Morton draws upon far-reaching original interviews and research, accompanied by exclusive private photographs, to show us the true story behind both the wild excesses of Angelina&#39;s youth and her remarkable work with children and victims of poverty and disaster today.&lt;/p&gt;" />
