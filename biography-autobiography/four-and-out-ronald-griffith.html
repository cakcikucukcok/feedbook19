  <title>Four and Out - Ronald Griffith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Much has been written about Vietnam and life in the Army. In almost every case the pictures, documentaries, and books concentrate on one of two major subjects. Most have been about life in combat with movies such as Yawn Wayne in Green Beret or Chuck Bore-us in his combat action flicks. Almost all of the documentaries were strictly about combat operations. The same can also be said about most of the pictures or documentaries coming out of World War I, II, Korea or Vietnam. 
The other type of picture features a unique character, such as the one played by Robin Williams in Good Morning Vietnam. There was also Sergeant Bilko or Gomer Pyle, for the older generation.
In reality, it took seven men to support one man in the field. You seldom read what life was like for any of those seven support personnel. This book gives you a glimpse into the life of a non-combatant Ditty Bopper in the top secret world of the Army Security Agency.
 A Ditty Bopper works with Morse code. All I had to do was sit back, relax, and listen to the radio while I enjoyed another cigarette with my fresh hot cup of coffee. Yes, life was tough in Vietnam with our air conditioned rooms, comfortable beds, clean linen, regular mail, an Enlisted Mens Club, four hot square meals a day, and a swimming pool for part of the time I was there.
SPECIAL BONUS
Ive included 80 full color pictures of my adventure in the ASA and most of the letters I sent home. Now you can read my on-the-spot comments. 
Remember The Ballad of the ASA, the 23 AR, or several of the other interesting pieces of literature written by someone someplace else? These are included." />
