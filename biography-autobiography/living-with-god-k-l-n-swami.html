  <title>Living with God - K. L. N. Swami</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is an attempt to let the world know that God has left His Foot Prints for the posterity to look behind and people who didnt find an opportunity to meet Him or see Him may still feel His Presence and receive His Blessings by joining any Sai Centre anywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have seen Swami the Divine, camouflaged as an ordinary human being moving with us, talking to us and eating with us. It is a nice feeling to relive my personal contacts with Bhagavan Sri Sathya Sai Baba Who has shown Himself in His Divine Form in resplendence to a few fortunate souls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I titled this book Living With GOD because I have that feeling of possessiveness when in His abundant Mercy admitted me into His Fold when He used to tell me We Are One Family. That has sustained me for decades keeping me fresh and vibrant.&lt;/p&gt;" />
