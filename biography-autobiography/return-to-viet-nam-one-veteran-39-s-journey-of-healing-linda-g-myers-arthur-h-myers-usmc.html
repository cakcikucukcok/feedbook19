  <title>Return to Viet Nam:  One Veteran&#39;s Journey of Healing - Linda G. Myers, Arthur H. Myers Usmc</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Art Myers is a Viet Nam veteran with memories. In 2005 he and his wife Linda traveled to Viet Nam with a group led by a psychotherapist who works with veterans affected by Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).  From the Mekong Delta in the south, to Hanoi in the north, it was a life-changing journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Art&#39;s story is not unusual. He was a sergeant in the Marine Corps in 1968, a radio repairman stationed at Da Nang during the Tet offensive. He saw only one day of combat, but that day affected every aspect of his life for 35 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many veterans suffer from their memories of their time at war. They may bury them, or deny them, or run from them, or act out in other areas of their lives. Alcoholism, drug addiction and suicide rates are higher than average, as are failed relationships and chronic unemployment.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Art decided to return to Viet Nam, to overlay the memories of the young man during a terrible time with those of a man in late middle age. It was a good choice for him - and for his family.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;About the book Art says, &quot;I hope that talking about this journey of healing - and how it has changed me  will help other veterans and their families. The idea of helping even one other veteran stop the nightmares and gain some peace made my story worth sharing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
