  <title>The Knot Will Hold - Walter K. Tuzeneu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the story of the 320th Glider Field Artillery Battalion
(GAFBN). It is also the story of virtue of the 105 mm howitzer. The
320th Battalion was one of several battalions in the Eighty-Second
Airborne Division. There was the 319th, 320th, 325th battalions as
well as the kitchen and headquarters battalions. Also, included in the
Eighty-Second Airborne Division were several paratrooper battalions
numbered in the five hundreds.
The 320th was composed of six gun crews to man the 105 mm
howitzers. Each crew consisted of a gun crew chief as well as five or six
crew members. The 320th gun crew chiefs were Sergeant Tuzzie, the first
gun crew, Sergeant Sackett, Sergeant Swain, Sergeant Sword, Sergeant
Parker, and Sergeant Rehenquist. In each crew, there were two breech
men and a soldier in charge of the lanyard.
There were several sizes of howitzers. There was the 75 mm pack mule
howitzer, the 105 mm howitzer, the 155 mm howitzer, and the 220 mm
long-barrel howitzer. The 105 mm howitzer was the only one adapted to
fit a glider to make it airborne. It was shortened to fit into the glider. It
was at the infamous Mt. Casino in Italy, which had a sharp cliff with a
drop of about nine hundred to a thousand feet, which the snub-nosed
105 mm howitzers were dug in, with their barrels pointing almost
straight up. This cliff gave the enemy a complete view and control over
the valley below. Their positions along the top made it almost impossible
to shoot or hit either the men or emplacements. The small arms fires or
shells would go over the ridge and land beyond their positions. From this
angle at the base of the cliff, the artillery shells of the 105 mm snub-nosed
howitzers could be landed along the ridge which made the Krauts, as they
were called, scramble to get away from the devastating fire so accurately
hitting their positions. It was learned later that the Germans had no idea
where the shelling came from or why it was so accurate." />
