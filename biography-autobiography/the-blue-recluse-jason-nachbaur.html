  <title>The Blue Recluse - Jason Nachbaur</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There should be more. But I know theres more in store. 
Good morning again, sunshine, my friend. Get up. Get going. You were meant to fly. First step out the door, and this was just my creative way to beg for your change. I see it every day, and we could never be the same. Individually different, and Ive earned that respect. If youve made it this far, thanks for the support. This is just another doomsday report.-
Hick* 
When the wind blows. 
When the wind blows you can feel the air, 
You can feel the air as it passes through your hair. 
Say I was indoors. 
Indoors at an airport caf chair. 
I wouldnt feel the air. 
I wouldnt feel the air until you stepped past me, from here to over there." />
