  <title>Sane Enough: Recovery From a Mother&#39;s Sexual Abuse - Linda Day, Obe Michele Elliott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;WINNER, Foreword Reviews INDIEFAB Book of the Year Award: Narrowed down from nearly 2,000 entries by a panel of librarians and booksellers, along with Foreword Reviews&amp;#39; editorial staff, the winners in 66 categories are considered the year&amp;#39;s best books published by independent publishers, university presses, and self-published authors.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;From Foreword Reviews:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sane Enough is a challenging, insightful and rare work that offers poignant insights into what it&amp;rsquo;s like to survive childhood sexual abuse.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;From award-winning freelance writer Linda Day comes a psychologically challenging memoir almost two decades in the making. Sane Enough is the unflinching account of one woman&amp;rsquo;s struggle to grow into herself&amp;hellip; Is she lesbian? Does she really want love? Why does sex always feel so wrong?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Day&amp;rsquo;s story involves a host of complicated figures: therapists whose inattention and impropriety bleed into abuse territory; sexual partners who are both frustrated and manipulative; and dark members of her family. Day draws from diaries and old letters to flesh out these characters, and punctuates her memories with psychological insights.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Day&amp;rsquo;s work is self-aware, her prose elegant and her familiarity with the nuances of the subject apparent. Some moments will sear their ways into the consciousness. The tactile nature of Day&amp;rsquo;s scene setting makes such moments all the more devastating. Moreover, Day&amp;rsquo;s willingness to give room to those who doubt her&amp;mdash;who read her manuscript and accused her of invention&amp;mdash;brings into relief the fraught nature of abuse revelations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is a hard and honest book to work through, but its pages constitute a valuable entry into more open discussions of childhood sexual abuse&amp;hellip; [and] the naked nature of her recollections may inspire others toward similar acts of bravery.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;OTHER REVIEWS:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Linda Day tells her story with candor and pulls no punches. Sane Enough is a testament&amp;hellip; a memoir that should be required reading.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash;Linda Sexton, author of Searching for Mercy Street: My Journey Back To My Mother, Anne Sexton&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Insightful and pithy, Sane Enough brings you into a hidden world&amp;hellip; Important for survivors and anyone who cares about children.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash;Dr. Michele Elliott, Order of the British Empire, Winston Churchill Fellow&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Linda opens our minds and hearts in this beautifully written memoir... emotionally riveting truth.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash;Roberta Dolan, author of Say It Out Loud: Revealing and Healing the Scars of Sexual Abuse&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A wonderful book, beautifully written and very moving.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash;Sheri Oz, author of Overcoming Childhood Sexual Trauma&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Searing, inspiring, courageous, illuminating&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash;Dr. Caitilin Stetson, psychologist&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Today was the first day ever that I was able to say my truth out loud in therapy ... I am so thankful for you and that you helped me exhale my truth so that I could continue to breathe. Happy Valentine&amp;#39;s Day Linda &amp;lt;3 &amp;lt;3&amp;quot; -Holly, a survivor of mother-daughter sexual abuse.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;FROM THE BACK COVER:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sane Enough chronicles Linda Day&amp;rsquo;s quest to uncover and understand her sexual confusion, as she confronts traumatic divorce, repressed memories, and unexpected encounters with childhood selves. With questionable help from a disbelieving therapist, she stares down disaster and finds hilarity where there&amp;rsquo;s not much to celebrate. Day&amp;rsquo;s professional life has included biomedical research, IBM systems engineerings, sales and management, freelance carpentry, and 25 years as an award-winning writer.&lt;/p&gt;" />
