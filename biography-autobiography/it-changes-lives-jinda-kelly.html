  <title>It Changes Lives - Jinda Kelly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Author Jinda Kelly has wanted to be a doctor since childhood. Decades of medical training and clinical work have informed her lifelong search for the root causes of illness and further defined for her a fundamental difference between healing and curing. She now believes that the process of healing goes far beyond that of simply curing and requires something extraordinary.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In It &lt;i&gt;Changes Lives&lt;/i&gt;, a wide range of modalities in holistic medicine were used to help patients in their healing processes, from orthodox to epigenetics, acupuncture to energy medicine, as well as homeopathy and nutritional approaches. She tells the stories of those people whose journeys she shared as they travelled through their illnesses, sometimes in cases where there did not seem to be a cure. From the leap of faith necessary to help the boy who kissed the duck to the understanding of Aboriginal spirituality that helped a woman recover her memory, these anecdotes describe those who made headway against chronic illness for which orthodox/allopathic medicine alone had no answers.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Inspiring to doctors and patients alike, this collection of personal narratives offers accounts of extraordinary healing through holistic medicine.&lt;/P&gt;" />
