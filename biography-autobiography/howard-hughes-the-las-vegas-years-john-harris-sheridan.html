  <title>Howard Hughes: the Las Vegas Years - John Harris Sheridan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Many people know about Howard Hughes, Americas first billionaire. He was an aviation engineer, an Oscar-winning motion picture producer and director,
        and a hotel and casino owner in Las Vegas and Reno, with seven establishments. He built the biggest airplane in the world at the timeknown as the
        Spruce Gooseand the Glormar Explorer supership for the CIA. He owned RKO Motion Picture Studios in Hollywood, as well as tens of thousands of acres in
        California, Nevada, and Texas.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Fewer people, however, know the Howard Hughes of the neon world of Las Vegas in the 1970s. Reclusive and eccentric, Hughes spent his later years
        surrounded by Mormon aides who insulated him from outsiders. This collection of biographical anecdotes includes stories of the power players of the
        timecelebrities, famous actresses, and the Las Vegas Mafiaas well as tales of Hughess bevy of less-well-known ladies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Told by an insider who knew Hughes in that era, these stories reveal new aspects of an American icon, set against the background of Sin City, the town
        he loved so much.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        John has captured a fascinating era here; I know  I was there.
        &lt;br/&gt;
        Alvin Zuckert, Emmy-award winning television director
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Johns book caused me to relive an exciting and wonderful time in my life. There were sides of Hughes you never knew existed  until now!

    &lt;p&gt;
        No crapshoot here; Johns got an absolute winner.
