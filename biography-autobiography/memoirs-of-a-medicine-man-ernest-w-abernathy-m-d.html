  <title>Memoirs of a Medicine Man - Ernest W. Abernathy M.D</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0.25in&quot;&gt;The practice of medicine or surgery is not just sore throats, colds and the flu, removing gall bladders, or back aches and belly aches. It is, however, a roller-coaster cornucopia of people and events where drama, comedy, the heights of joy and the depths of sadness are only moments away, as if a revolving door is constantly ejecting the next encounter - a child with appendicitis, a broken arm, the Ku Klux Klan with death threats, gunshot wounds, snake handlers, con artists, sex, racism, rape, a sweet old lady with arthritis, or some addict - a never-ending myriad.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0.25in&quot;&gt;Thankfully, most of my patients and I grew old together in an air of love and mutual respect, in an era of closeness between patients and doctors, when doctors really cared  not only about the patient&#39;&#39;s health, but also about the patients themselves.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0.25in&quot;&gt;Medical school forgot to mention ethics, or talk about humanistic qualities, abstract values outside the world of science. The patient is not just a patient case, (that &quot;gallbladder&quot; in room 911), or a number, but is a unique human being, with emotions, feelings, worthiness, fears, hopes and worries, as well as the capabilities of understanding and courage in the face of disaster. He or she deserves full respect.&lt;/P&gt;
