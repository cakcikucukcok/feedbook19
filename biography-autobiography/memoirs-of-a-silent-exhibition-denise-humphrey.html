  <title>Memoirs of a Silent Exhibition - Denise Humphrey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Within the first few months of her marriage, Denise Humphrey learned that her husband was gay. Tortured by intense and conflicted emotions she existed alone and shut away from life as if in a coffin, both during the marriage and the decade after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denise and John loved each other in many ways, making their situation very tragic. They met each other as classical pianists, performed duets together, enjoyed each others company, and wanted to be parents. At the same time, parts of their lives were closeted from other people, as well as from each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early in the marriage, John became a medical doctor, and later Denise became a psychologist. After having two delightful sons they both absolutely loved and adored  and still do  the torment of her shuttered life increased even more dramatically because of intense fear that her feelings of shame and secrecy would be passed on to the boys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the memoir you will embrace the enormous struggles Denise endured, how she eventually decided to end the marriage, how Denise and John disclosed to their sons, and how all four of them grew even closer through the process. This memoir reveals its resolution and miraculous metamorphosis. Life tragedies can be surpassed!&lt;br /&gt;
