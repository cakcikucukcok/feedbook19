  <title>Atlas - Teddy Atlas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Of all the people who have affected by my life and influence the choices I&#39;ve made, none has been more important than my father.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So begins the autobiography of legendary boxing trainer and commentator Teddy Atlas, who grew from the rebellious son of a doctor to a man who embraces, and lives by, his father&#39;s values and code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this gritty, spellbinding tale, Atlas recounts his fascinating life -- as a juvenile delinquent on the streets of Staten Island; as a boxer and Golden Gloves champion under the tutelage of famed trainer Cus D&#39;Amato; as a companion to the dangerous, unpredictable Sammy &quot;the Bull&quot; Gravano, up until the day Gravano turned rat and brought down crime boss John Gotti; and as a trainer of champions and contenders, among them fourteen-year-old Mike Tyson and heavyweight Michael Moorer, whom he led to the crown with a win over Evander Holyfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Equally engrossing are Teddy Atlas&#39;s accounts of training dancer and choreographer Twyla Tharp for her successful comeback at age forty-two; his work with actor Willem Dafoe, preparing him for his role as a concentration camp boxer in the film &lt;em&gt;Triumph of the Spirit&lt;/em&gt;; his journey to Poland to choreograph the film&#39;s boxing scenes; and his own performance in movies such as &lt;em&gt;Play It to the Bone&lt;/em&gt;. In sharing his stories, Atlas reveals the philosophy by which he lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Teddy Atlas -- inimitable, tough, honest, and wise -- this book inspires. It is about so much more than boxing. It is a story of overcoming hardships, of compassion for those in need, of tremendous personal integrity, and of personal and professional triumph.&lt;/p&gt;" />
