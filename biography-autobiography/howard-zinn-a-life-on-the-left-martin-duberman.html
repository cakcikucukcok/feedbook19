  <title>Howard Zinn: A Life on the Left - Martin Duberman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Howard Zinn was perhaps the best-known and most widely celebrated popular interpreter of American history in the twentieth century, renowned as a bestselling author, a political activist, a lecturer, and one of America&amp;#8217;s most recognizable and admired progressive voices.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;His rich, complicated, and fascinating life placed Zinn at the heart of the signal events of modern American history&amp;#151;from the battlefields of World War II to the McCarthy era, the civil rights and the antiwar movements, and beyond. A bombardier who later renounced war, a son of working-class parents who earned a doctorate at Columbia, a white professor who taught at the historically black Spelman College in Atlanta, a committed scholar who will be forever remembered as a devoted &amp;#147;people&amp;#8217;s historian&amp;#8221;&amp;#151;Howard Zinn blazed a bold, iconoclastic path through the turbulent second half of the twentieth century.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;For the millions who were moved by Zinn&amp;#8217;s personal example of political engagement and by his inspiring &amp;#147;bottom up&amp;#8221; history, here is an authoritative biography of this towering figure&amp;#151;by Martin Duberman, recipient of the American Historical Association&amp;#8217;s 2007 Lifetime Achievement Award. Given exclusive access to the previously closed Zinn archives, Duberman&amp;#8217;s impeccably researched biography is illustrated with never-before-published photos from the Zinn family collection. &lt;I&gt;Howard Zinn: A Life on the Left&lt;/I&gt; is a major publishing event that brings to life one of the most inspiring figures of our time.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
