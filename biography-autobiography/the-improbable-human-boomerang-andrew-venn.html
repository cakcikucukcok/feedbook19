  <title>The Improbable Human Boomerang - Andrew Venn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Im back! Like a human boomerang I returned to this earth after an improbable survival from a brain haemorrhage and after the resultant, enlightening and intriguing  coma but my prognosis looked about as cheerful as the landscape on the planet Jupiter and at 24 years of age my sudden disabilities were about as welcoming as a slap in the face from a urine-soaked slipper! 
             Life for me was paused like interrupted vows at a wedding but the scenes that I would powerfully experience whilst I lay in a coma would convincingly favour a belief in reincarnation and suggest a constant recycling of our souls! 
             I have tried to continue from where I left off by marrying my Fiance Laura(who stayed by my side) and then a year later becoming a proud Father to a baby boy who was, unfortunately, born prematurely but thankfully he survived and his development has provided scenes of both upset but mostly laughter!
            This book is like a humorous diary of those events during the Wedding with some(only some!) of our honeymoon experiences but all laughter is temporarily but appropriately paused during some upsetting experiences in hospital because of our sons illnesses but his progression(sometimes very comical) recalled some of my youthful and calamitous experiences! 
            Were all conscious about the need to recycle, well it is my belief(that have been established from my experiences whilst I was in a coma) that our souls have been recycled since the Creation/formation of the earth and death is not the final ending of your existence but the mere closure of a chapter in this lifetime!" />
