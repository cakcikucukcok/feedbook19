  <title>Evolution&#39;s Captain: NF abt Capt. FitzRoy &amp; Chas Darwin - Peter Nichols</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is the story of the man without whom the name Charles Darwin might be unknown to us today. That man was Captain Robert FitzRoy, who invited the 22-year-old Darwin to be his companion on board the &lt;em&gt;Beagle&lt;/em&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the remarkable story of how a misguided decision by Robert FitzRoy, captain of HMS &lt;em&gt;Beagle&lt;/em&gt; , precipitated his employment of a young naturalist named Charles Darwin, and how the clash between FitzRoy&amp;#8217;s fundamentalist views and Darwin&amp;#8217;s discoveries led to FitzRoy&amp;#8217;s descent into the abyss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the great ironies of history is that the famous journey&amp;#8212;wherein Charles Darwin consolidated the earth-rattling &amp;#8216;origin of the species&amp;#8217; discoveries&amp;#8212;was conceived by another man: Robert FitzRoy. It was FitzRoy who chose Darwin for the journey&amp;#8212;not because of Darwin&amp;#8217;s scientific expertise, but because he seemed a suitable companion to help FitzRoy fight back the mental illness that had plagued his family for generations. Darwin did not give FitzRoy solace; indeed, the clash between the two men&amp;#8217;s opposing views, together with the ramifications of Darwin&amp;#8217;s revelations, provided FitzRoy with the final unendurable torment that forced him to end his own life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
