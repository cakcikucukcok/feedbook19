  <title>The Guardians - Sarah Manguso</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Guardians&lt;/i&gt; opens with a story from the July 24, 2008, edition of the &lt;i&gt;Riverdale Press&lt;/i&gt; that begins, &quot;An unidentified white man was struck and instantly killed by a Metro-North train last night as it pulled into the station on West 254th Street.&quot; Sarah Manguso writes: &quot;The train&#39;s engineer told the police that the man was alone and that he jumped. The police officers pulled the body from the track and found no identification. The train&#39;s 425 passengers were transferred to another train and delayed about twenty minutes.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Guardians&lt;/i&gt; is an elegy for Manguso&#39;s friend Harris, two years after he escaped from a psychiatric hospital and jumped under that train. The narrative contemplates with unrelenting clarity their crowded postcollege apartment, Manguso&#39;s fellowship year in Rome, Harris&#39;s death and the year that followed--the year of mourning and the year of Manguso&#39;s marriage. As Harris is revealed both to the reader and to the narrator, the book becomes a monument to their intimacy and inability to express their love to each other properly, and to the reverberating effects of Harris&#39;s presence in and absence from Manguso&#39;s life. There is grief in the book but also humor, as Manguso marvels at the unexpected details that constitute a friendship. &lt;i&gt;The Guardians&lt;/i&gt; explores the insufficiency of explanation and the necessity of the imagination in making sense of anything.&lt;/p&gt;" />
