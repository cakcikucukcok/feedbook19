  <title>Seeking More of the Sky - Charles N. Stevens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The stories presented in this book follow the life of a young boy growing up in Inglewood, California, a suburb of Los Angeles, during the 1930s. The author lived during the depression when unemployment was affecting many and banks were closed, while the clouds of war were gathering in Europe. But he was lucky enough to be raised in a loving family, the power of that love reflected throughout his stories. 
The day when boys would have cell phones, television, smart phones, and Ipads was in the far distant future. Boys made do with what they hadold tires, bottle caps, marbles, spools, and anything else they could find around the house, forcing them to be inventive in their play. 
It was a period when milkmen delivered milk in bottles, icemen brought blocks of ice for the ice box, and the sound of steam locomotives echoed through the town. 
These true stories take the reader back to a simpler time. Older readers may find a little of themselves in the stories while the young may be amazed by how boys lived over seventy-five years ago." />
