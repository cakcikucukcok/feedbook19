  <title>Forging a President - William Hazelgrove</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&quot;There are few sensations I prefer to that of galloping over these rolling limitless prairies, with rifle in hand, or winding my way among the barren, fantastic and grimly picturesque deserts of the so-called Bad Lands.&quot; —Theodore Roosevelt&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He was born a city boy in Manhattan; but it wasn&#39;t until he lived as a cattle rancher and deputy sheriff in the wild country of the Dakota Territory that Theodore Roosevelt became the man who would be president. &quot;I have always said I would not have been president had it not been for my experience in North Dakota,&quot; Roosevelt later wrote. It was in the &quot;grim fairyland&quot; of the Bad Lands that Roosevelt became acquainted with the ways of cowboys, Native Americans, trappers, thieves, and wild creatures--and it was there that his spirit was forged and tested.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Forging a President&lt;/em&gt;, author William Hazelgrove uses Roosevelt&#39;s own reflections to immerse readers in the formative seasons that America&#39;s twenty-sixth president spent in &quot;the broken country&quot; of the Wild West.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
