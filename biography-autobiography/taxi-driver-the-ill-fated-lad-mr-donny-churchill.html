  <title>Taxi Driver—The Ill Fated Lad - Mr. Donny Churchill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a real life story about the beauty of life when you have a wonderful income, which ultimately gave me a glamorous lifestyle. I had a lavished apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, where I was always entertaining my friends and their friends. Sometimes my friends and I would use limousine just for the night out. At the end of my company contract and after about another six months without income, I sold my condominium at a reasonable price and relocated to Jersey City in New Jersey. I lived in a spacious apartment for another five months without income, then I decided to drive a yellow cab. I went to TLC for my hack license to enable me to drive a taxi. I registered with a taxi company in Brooklyn, and I became a taxi driver. Driving the taxi and continuing my job hunting at the same time was daunting. With too many summonses from police officers and TLC inspectors within a period of about four years taxi driving, my license was revoked. No more taxi driving, no more income. And my life became too miserable." />
