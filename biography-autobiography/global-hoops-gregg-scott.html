  <title>Global Hoops - Gregg Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Mental Athlete unleashes a MASTERPIECE!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Gregg Scotts Global Hoops: Mind, Body &amp; Soul&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Performance Guru and Ex-Intl. Pro Basketball Player presents True Tales, Tools &amp; Teachings&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behold a book created to be judged by its cover. Visually Captivating. Stimulating Content. Using his International pro basketball pedigree as a platform, Gregg Scott artfully designed Global Hoops: Mind, Body and Soul (&lt;a href=&quot;http://bookstore.trafford.com/Products/SKU-000141596/Global-Hoops.aspx&quot;&gt;published by Trafford Publishing&lt;/a&gt;) as an apt universal Readers Digest guidebook of Mindsets, Concepts, Quotes and Quips destined to impact the psyche and the journey of every reader. Sharing his true-life tales of perseverance, the keen mental tools and mentoring teachings he has utilized, cultivated and shared, globally, Scott presents a unique mixture of Mind and Body Conditioning told in a self-help format based on his 25-year brand, The Mental Athlete Workshop. A manual born as a trainer to Ironman Tri-athletes in Kona, HI, branded in San Diego as a UCSD fitness instructor, boosted by the Adidas Euro Camps, boasted of by FIBA, broadcasted as a live radio show, and bona fide by dozens of testimonials by those he has coached, mentored, trained and taught worldwide. The seeds planted sprouted success and praise from athletes, elated parents and sponsors. See It 2 Be It: GHMBS Tales, Tools and Teachings are linked via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/MentalAthlete/&quot;&gt;youtube.com/MentalAthlete&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workshop manual presentation has evolved into an epic infusion into G HOOPS with its 60-page current-day culmination, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;2016: The Modern-Day Mental Athlete Manifesto&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. A compass for athletes and parents to navigate todays AAU/Club &amp; H.S. competitive sports landscape. Engraining introspective traits and insights that are life-changing and lifelong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dedicated to his mother, daughter Gabriella, and HOF pro tennis player Gabriela Sabatini, Global Hoops is the fulfillment of Scotts promise to the crowd of spectators after his MVP performance in a 1987 All-Star game in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Impressed, young Sabatini summoned Scott, via his agent, for a personal autograph and a memorable private meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scotts Global Hoops quest spanned &lt;i&gt;Nine Seasons, traversing 13 Countries, and a Million Miles Playing International Pro Basketball&lt;/i&gt;. Featuring hundreds of awe-inspiring pictures, clips, tributes and tutelage from his storied career, Scott pays homage to the many coaches, mentors, teachers, trainers and teammates who molded him, and details the &#39;Occupational Hazards&#39; and survival skills of a Pro &#39;Import&#39; Player in the &#39;Amateur&#39; FIBA basketball galaxy. G Hoops illuminates the historic places and celeb faces he saw on his globetrotting journey with engaging anecdotes of his times with legends and luminaries; from Wooden to Walton, Petrovic to Pippen, Iceman Gervin to Alexander Gomelsky, Magic to Mutombo, Kareem to Kerr, Detlef to Dirk, Barkley to Barry, Joe Jellybean to Kobe Bryant.
