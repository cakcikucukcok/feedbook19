  <title>Justified Anger - Jennifer Colne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A mother&#39;s story of how historic child sexual abuse can affect the lives of the victims. It shows the determination of a mother fighting the system and seeking justice. How she loses so much, but through her strength and tenacity, she faces the inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She supports her children at their time of need. When the trauma was buried deep within their subconscious; behaviour presents itself in an irrational manner. Being naive to this situation and not believing this could happen to her family, she has to learn fast in order to understand self-harm and suicidal thoughts. The people she meets along the way, help show her the path that can lead to a better understanding of why and how things must take their course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She learned through heartache, how other people&#39;s feelings, can be transmitted in a totally different aspect, to the truth. Family and friends find it difficult to believe, others don&#39;t wish to be involved. At times the subject is taboo and it also shows the stigma towards mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is written to help others, recognise when a young victim conceals the emotional pain and the conscious mind of the adult, is terrifi ed of acknowledging the abuse.&lt;/p&gt;" />
