  <title>Advice to Young Men - And (Incidentally) to Young Women in the Middle and Higher Ranks of Life. In a Series of Letters, Addressed to a Youth, a Bachel - William Cobbett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Advice to Young Men&quot; is a guidebook for young gentlemen that offers advice on many accepts of life, including monetary matters, relationships, etiquette, attire, fatherhood, and much more. This volume will appeal to those with an interest in early nineteenth-century manners, and it would make for a fantastic addition to collections of allied literature. Contents include: &quot;Letter I. To A Youth&quot;, &quot;Letter II. To A Young Man&quot;, &quot;Letter III. To A Lover&quot;, &quot;Letter IV. To A Husband&quot;, &quot;Letter V. To A Father&quot;, and &quot;Letter VI. To The Citizen&quot;. William Cobbett (1763 - 1835) was an English  farmer, pamphleteer, and journalist. He was a staunch believer in parliamentary reform and championed the idea of abolishing &quot;rotten&quot; boroughs to help end the poverty of farm labourers. He was also a keen polemicist, although he is most famous for this book, &quot;Rural Rides&quot;. Other notable works by this author include: &quot;Cottage Economy&quot; ( 1822), &quot;The Housekeeper&#39;s Magazine and Family Economist&quot; (1826), and &quot;The Poor Man&#39;s Friend; or, Essays on the Rights and Duties of the Poor&quot; (1829).  Many vintage books such as this are becoming increasingly scarce and expensive. We are republishing this volume now in an affordable, modern, high-quality edition complete with a specially commissioned new biography of the author." />
