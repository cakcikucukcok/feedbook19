      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Description&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Included in this eBook Boxset is Eric Otis Simmons&amp;#39; multi-time best-selling Memoir, &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;Not Far From The Tree&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;#HTSP - How to Self-Publish&lt;/b&gt;,&amp;rdquo; at &lt;b&gt;&amp;frac12; Off Retail!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Not Far From The Tree&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In &amp;ldquo;&lt;b&gt; Not Far From The Tree&lt;/b&gt;,&amp;rdquo; Simmons shares how his single-parent African American Mother equipped him for future academic, athletic, and business success in Corporate America.&amp;nbsp; Throughout his Memoir, Simmons masterfully ties together his Mother&amp;rsquo;s teachings with how he utilized them to overcome seemingly insurmountable odds such as selling an IBM computer system to then segregationist Alabama Governor George Corley Wallace&amp;rsquo;s office, and the events leading up to him closing sales of $1/2 million, $1 million and $25 million in Paris, Brussels, and Hong Kong.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;#HTSP - How to Self-Publish&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;#HTSP - How to Self-Publish&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot;, a concise 90-page &amp;ldquo;how-to,&amp;rdquo; Simmons shares the methodology he developed to successfully self-publish, market and distribute his Memoir.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Thorough! That&amp;#39;s the word I would use to describe #HTSP.&amp;nbsp; Simmons left no stone unturned with this one.&amp;nbsp; Pretty much any question a first-time self-publisher could ask seems to have been addressed by this book.&lt;br /&gt;
