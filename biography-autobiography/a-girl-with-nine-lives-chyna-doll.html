  <title>A Girl with Nine Lives - Chyna Doll</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Over the years of my life I have realized the aspects of my lifethe drug abuse, being molested, domestic violence, and rape. Each situation had to be addressed by me writing my thoughts. I started out as a diary and after a while, when it was healthy for my soul, by me writing my thoughts on what happened to me, on the things people did to me, and on how they treated me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My writing relieves some of the stress and pain. I look back on my life and as I write. I relive it over and over again. I recreated it all over the foibles of others as time went on, so I could forgive by telling my secrets and my story. Some of my most deeply hidden thoughts were pushed back to the back of my mind for years so that I could deal with it at a later time; I just went on living my life until I was able to deal with it years later.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I was so ashamed to tell anyone. I was embarrassed. By writing every day, trying to work out my past events and in the conflicts, writing is a way to cleanse my soul. It is and can be an effective method of treatment emotionally and physically. Forgiving myself and others took a long time as far as the domestic violence in my life. I still live in fear every day not knowing if the man was or is ever caught.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;All the names have been changed to maintain their privacy. I pray my story may help and reach someone who may be in trouble and who needs to reach out. You dont have to be silent anymore. Find someone you can trust and tell them what is going on with you. There is help today.&lt;/p&gt;" />
