  <title>The 50 Greatest Players in Denver Broncos History - Mike Klis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;The 50 Greatest Players in Denver Broncos History&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; examines the careers of the 50 men who made the greatest impact on one of the National Football League&amp;rsquo;s most successful franchises. Using as measuring sticks the degree to which they impacted the fortunes of the team, the extent to which they added to the Bronco legacy of excellence, and the levels of statistical compilation and overall dominance they attained while wearing a Bronco uniform, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;The 50 Greatest Players in Denver Broncos History&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; ranks, from 1 to 50, the top 50 players in team history. Quotes from the players themselves and former teammates are provided along the way, as are summaries of each player&amp;rsquo;s greatest season, most memorable performances, and most notable achievements. From Hall of Fame players such as John Elway, Floyd Little, and Shannon Sharpe to forgotten greats such as Rulon Jones and Lionel Taylor, the Broncos&amp;rsquo; best are profiled here in what is bound to be a much-discussed book among the team&amp;rsquo;s broad fan base.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
