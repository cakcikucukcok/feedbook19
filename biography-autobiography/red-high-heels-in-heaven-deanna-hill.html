  <title>Red High Heels in Heaven - Deanna Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On the way to Nebraska in 1986 my life was changed forever in the blink of an eye when the tour bus on which I was traveling slammed into an 18-wheel tanker. After the accident and during my recovery my sister was keeping a journal, which she told me was to help me write my book. From time to time through the years I thought about that book, especially when I would share my story at churches or one-on-one and people would say, &quot;You need to write a book&quot; However, my second thought would always be, &quot;Who would ever want to read about me&quot; and I would shove the idea back to the corner of my mind where it had been hanging out for years. Finally a few years ago after being introduced to a word processor, I sat down and began to write my story. The computer made the writing part easy enough, but telling the story was one of the most difficult things I have ever done. It took weeks and weeks of reading and rereading my sister&#39;s journal and digging up memories deeply buried, which were painful to review. I won&#39;t say it was exactly a labor of love, but I am glad I finally did it. It is my prayer that people will be encouraged and inspired by reading how God has brought me through it all. If I seem courageous or special in any way it is because of Him." />
