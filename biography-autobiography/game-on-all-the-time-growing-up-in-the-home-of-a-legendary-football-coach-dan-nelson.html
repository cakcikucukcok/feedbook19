  <title>Game On All the Time: Growing Up in the Home of a Legendary Football Coach - Dan Nelson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Game On All the Time: Growing up in the Home of a Legendary Football Coach &lt;/em&gt;describes how football is king in South Mississippi where the author grew up. L.R. Nelson was an&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;exemplary father and the football coach in the country community of Agricola, Mississippi. His oldest son Dan seeks to convey the excitement and humor of hanging out in the locker room as a kid while watching his Father coach and influence many who went on to greater accomplishments either on or off the sports field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Game On All the Time&lt;/em&gt; features homespun stories about characters in the small farming community, coupled with football rivalries and games. These are guaranteed to bring a smile to your face and help you identify with some character or story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emotionally charged environment of high school football is seen as an integral part of community cohesiveness in the South. His father&amp;#39;s powerful influence and the character building values learned from him are essential parts of the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the book chronicles his father&amp;#39;s life and coaching career in a concise manner, the heart of the book is found in the humorous stories, and characters described in the chapter: &amp;quot;Master Motivator and Interesting Stories.&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;In these stories you find highlights of his father&amp;#39;s coaching career, plus other infamous individuals and stories from the place where Nelson grew up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Game On All the Time&lt;/em&gt; shows how a father can fuel a competitive spirit in his sons while at the same time instill values through his involvement in their lives. You are bound to like &lt;em&gt;Game on All the Time &lt;/em&gt;and want to share it with a friend. It will appeal to all sports fans as well as parents desiring to have a positive impact in their children&amp;#39;s lives.
