He explain&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;s the persistence and determination it took to get accepted to Notre Dame, to suit up and play for twenty-seven glorious seconds, and to see the dream of his movie become a reality. Rudy is truly a real-life testament to the old adage that it is not how many times you get knocked down, but how many times you get up again. He will motivate you to discover your own dreams and to them with unrelenting faith that anything is possible. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
