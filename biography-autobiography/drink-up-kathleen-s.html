  <title>Drink Up! - Kathleen S.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Recovery Road Less Traveled&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kathleen S. had tried just about everything to quit drinking. Nothing worked. A binge drinker who felt she was already living on borrowed time (two of her brothers died of addiction-related causes in their 40s), her life and health were rapidly breaking down. Then one day she heard a radio advertisement for a treatment program that promised to take away her cravings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the addiction treatment in the U.S. is based on AA attendance and working a twelve-step program. Physicians, the court system, insurance companies, and members themselves often look at AA as the only legitimate mode of recovery from substance abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;This book describes another program.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;This book says it all. Staying sober has been a piece of cake for me since Schick Shadel.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Chet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ten years ago I, too, walked the hallways of Schick Shadel Hospital. I share Kathys thankfulness for a life without alcohol and cravings, and for the loving care we received from the staff when we were patients. I validated my complete trust in the success of Schick Shadels treatment when I became the majority owner of the Hospital almost ten years ago. Kathy validated hers with the writing of this insightful and motivational book.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Jim Graham&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;I am glad that one of our patients, Kathleen S, wrote a book about the treatment from the patients perspective. This book is written factually, with warmth and humor. I hope it will encourage others to give up their addiction and regain their lives again.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
