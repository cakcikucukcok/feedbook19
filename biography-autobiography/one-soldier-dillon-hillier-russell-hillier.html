  <title>One Soldier - Dillon Hillier, Russell Hillier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The instant national bestseller. Dillon Hillier, a corporal with the Princess Patricia&amp;#8217;s Canadian Light Infantry, returned home from a tour in Afghanistan and started up a normal life. But when ISIS insurgents began attacking local populations in Iraq and elsewhere, Hillier, a long-time soldier, felt he had to join in the action, so he sold his truck, lied to his parents about where he was going and became the first Canadian to volunteer to fight ISIS in Iraq&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For three months, Dillon accompanied the Kurdish army as they fought a series of battles against the Islamic State throughout northern Iraq. During his mission, Dillon saw combat, experienced life in the trenches, partnered with a former US Marine, had a bounty placed on his head and learned an important truth: that in the chaos of war, the difference between life and death is measured in inches, and some things can never be forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;First Volunteer&lt;/em&gt; is about Hillier&amp;#8217;s three months fighting with the Kurds in Iraq, on the front lines. The only reason Dillon&amp;#8217;s tour wasn&amp;#8217;t longer was because the government wanted him back home, safe and sound.&lt;/p&gt;" />
