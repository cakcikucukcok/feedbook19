  <title>A Mighty Boy: A Mother&#39;s Journey Through Grief - Sarah Pullen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What would you do if a stranger told you your son was going to die?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silas is ten years old when the headaches start. When the diagnosis arrives, his parents are told they have until Christmas... maybe. And so begins Sarah Pullen&#39;s battle to save her son, against doubting doctors and insurmountable odds. This story about love and loss traces her family&#39;s journey from that first day at the hospital, battling a tumour they named &#39;Bob&#39;, through Silas&#39;s death and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This profoundly moving and honest account shows that it is possible to find the strength for a journey that no mother should ever go on; that it is possible to find a new way to live, even when death is knocking on the door. It is about confronting grief - raw, ugly, incomprehensible grief. It is a book about wrapping a small boy in love, but still letting him get grubby knees. It is about learning to savour every moment of the here and now, yet also learning to let go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At its heart, &lt;i&gt;A Mighty Boy&lt;/i&gt; is a story of the love between a mother and a son. It is a book about seizing the moment and somehow managing to survive the death of a child. But most of all it is a book about a small, mighty, smiling boy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
