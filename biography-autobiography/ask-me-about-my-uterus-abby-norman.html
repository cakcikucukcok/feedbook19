  <title>Ask Me About My Uterus - Abby Norman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;For any woman who has experienced illness, chronic pain, or endometriosis comes an inspiring memoir advocating for recognition of women&#39;s health issues&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;In the fall of 2010, Abby Norman&#39;s strong dancer&#39;s body dropped forty pounds and gray hairs began to sprout from her temples. She was repeatedly hospitalized in excruciating pain, but the doctors insisted it was a urinary tract infection and sent her home with antibiotics. Unable to get out of bed, much less attend class, Norman dropped out of college and embarked on what would become a years-long journey to discover what was wrong with her. It wasn&#39;t until she took matters into her own hands--securing a job in a hospital and educating herself over lunchtime reading in the medical library--that she found an accurate diagnosis of endometriosis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Ask Me About My Uterus&lt;/i&gt;, Norman describes what it was like to have her pain dismissed, to be told it was all in her head, only to be taken seriously when she was accompanied by a boyfriend who confirmed that her sexual performance was, indeed, compromised. Putting her own trials into a broader historical, sociocultural, and political context, Norman shows that women&#39;s bodies have long been the battleground of a never-ending war for power, control, medical knowledge, and truth. It&#39;s time to refute the belief that being a woman is a preexisting condition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
