  <title>Paul Verhoeven - Margaret Barton-Fumo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After a robust career in the Netherlands as the country&amp;#8217;s most successful director, Paul Verhoeven (b. 1938) built an impressive career in the United States with such controversial blockbusters as &lt;i&gt;RoboCop&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Total Recall&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Basic Instinct&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Starship Troopers&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Showgirls&lt;/i&gt; before returning home to direct 2006&amp;#8217;s &lt;i&gt;Black Book&lt;/i&gt;. After a recent stint as a reality television judge in the Netherlands, Verhoeven returned to the big screen with his first feature film in a decade, a highly anticipated French-language production, &lt;i&gt;Elle&lt;/i&gt;, starring Isabelle Huppert.&lt;p&gt;Verhoeven, who holds an advanced degree in mathematics and physics, boasts a fascinating background. Traversing Hollywood, the Dutch film industry, and now French filmmaking, the interviews in this volume reveal a complex, often ambiguous figure, as well as a director of immense talent.&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Paul Verhoeven: Interviews&lt;/i&gt; covers every phase of the director&amp;#8217;s career, beginning with six newly translated Dutch newspaper interviews dating back to 1968 and ending with a set of previously unpublished interviews dedicated to his most recent work. He experimented with crowd-sourced filmmaking for the television show &lt;i&gt;The Entertainment Experience&lt;/i&gt;, which resulted in the film &lt;i&gt;Tricked&lt;/i&gt;, as well as his latest feature &lt;i&gt;Elle&lt;/i&gt;. Editor Margaret Barton-Fumo includes &amp;#8220;Sex, Cinema and Showgirls,&amp;#8221; a long out-of-print essay by Verhoeven on his most controversial film, accompanied by pages of original storyboards from this and some of Verhoeven&amp;#8217;s other films. Finally, Barton-Fumo allots due attention to the director&amp;#8217;s little-known lifelong fascination with the historical Jesus Christ. Verhoeven is the only non-theologian member of the exclusive Westar Institute and author of the book &lt;i&gt;Jesus of Nazareth&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
