  <title>Buckley&#39;s Story - Ingrid King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Buckleys Story&lt;/i&gt; is the story of how one small cat changed the authors life in ways she never could have imagined. In this warm-hearted memoir, Ingrid King shares the story of Buckley, a joyful, enthusiastic and affectionate tortoiseshell cat she meets while managing a veterinary hospital. When Ingrid leaves her job at the veterinary hospital to start her own business, Buckley comes home to live with her and Amber, another tortoiseshell cat who had adopted the author several years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
Buckley is diagnosed with heart disease after only two years of living with Ingrid, and caring for Buckley through her illness only deepens the bond between cat and human. Interspersed with well-researched information about cat health in general, and heart disease in particular, the author describes the challenges and rewards of managing illness in a feline companion, and ultimately helping her through the final transition. Ingrid shares both the day-to-day joys of living with a special cat as well as the profound grief that comes with losing a beloved animal companion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Buckleys Story&lt;/i&gt; is a celebration of the soul connection between animals and humans, a connection that is eternal and transcends the physical dimension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;PRAISE FOR &lt;i&gt;Buckleys Story&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Buckleys Story&lt;/i&gt; is a true celebration of the bond between pets and their humans.  This story of a gimpy little tortoiseshell cat with a huge heart who changed her humans life in unexpected ways shows us how pets teach us universal lessons about living a joyful life, how caring for a terminally ill pet can deepen this special bond, and how to navigate the devastating grief that comes with losing a beloved animal companion.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;b&gt;Dr. Marty Becker&lt;/b&gt;, Americas Veterinarian and author of  &lt;i&gt;The Healing Power of Pets: Harnessing the Amazing Ability of Pets To Make and Keep People Happy and Healthy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;***&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Ingrid King loves animals, and in &lt;i&gt;Buckleys Story&lt;/i&gt; she leads us through how these precious creatures  in particular, one gimpy tortie named Buckley  can teach us how to open our hearts to the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;***&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
For those of us who thinkor, rather, knowthat cats have a thing or two to teach us in this life, youll appreciate Ingrid Kings story about her cat Buckley.&lt;/p&gt;
