  <title>And Nothing But the Truthiness - Lisa Rogak</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;A funny and personal portrait of the comedian who became the headline-making, ground-breaking star of&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;The Colbert Report&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;My name is Stephen Colbert, but I actually play someone on television named Stephen Colbert, who looks like me and talks like me, but who says things with a straight face [that] he doesn&#39;t mean.&quot;--Stephen Colbert&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No other comedian can generate headlines today the way Stephen Colbert can. With his appearance at a Congressional hearing, his rally in Washington, D.C., his bestselling book, his creation of the now-accepted word &lt;i&gt;truthiness&lt;/i&gt;, and of course his popular TV show, nearly everyone (except the poor Congressional fools who agree to be interviewed on his show) has heard of him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet all these things are part of a character also named Stephen Colbert. Who is he really? In &lt;i&gt;And Nothing But the Truthiness&lt;/i&gt;, biographer Lisa Rogak examines the man behind the character. She reveals the roots of his humor, growing up as the youngest of eleven siblings, and the tragedy that forever altered the family. She charts his early years earning his chops first as a serious acting student and later as a budding impov comic, especially his close connection with Amy Sedaris, which led to the cult TV show &lt;i&gt;Strangers with Candy&lt;/i&gt;. And Rogak offers a look inside how &lt;i&gt;The Daily Show&lt;/i&gt; works, and the exclusive bond that Colbert and Jon Stewart formed that would lead to Colbert&#39;s own rise to celebrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A behind-the-scenes look into the world of one of the biggest comedians in America, &lt;i&gt;And Nothing But the Truthiness&lt;/i&gt; is a terrific read for any resident of Colbert Nation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
