  <title>Following Breadcrumbs - Jamie Johnston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As an LA tween in the mid-1960s, Jamie Johnstonfree-spirited, fiercely independent Hollywood brat and daughter of 40s/50s actor-singer Johnny Johnston (Rock Around the Clock)had two significant events forever frozen in her mind.
The first of these memories she would share with millionsthe era-defining appearance of the Beatles on Ed Sullivan in 1964. The second memory, however, was much more intimate. It was a bright summers day in 1966 when she stood rapt, watching one of the undisputed kings of the Sunset Strip, the Byrds Gene Clark, coolly entering the legendary Whisky a Go Go. 
Little did Jamie know that a mere nine years after having her life changed by the Fab Four, her female duo, the Skiffles, would be signed to a record deal with Beatles producer, George Martin, or that twenty years hence, she would embark upon a passionate affair with the ill-fated ex-Byrd Clark, who died at the age of forty-six in 1991.
What begins as an up-close-and-personal commentary of an era that changed the world, with many of its famous players traversing through the pages, evolves into a tragic love story.
