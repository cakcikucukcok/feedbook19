  <title>Love@Politics - Roshan Kumar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Akansha , a young, dynamic journalist, always had everything going her way.
From the best scholar in School to the college president and then a job to die for. She had not known rejection and there was no need of it either. She was hard working , intelligent , out of the league and the luck&#39;s favorite.
They say , all that begins well , ends well. But the path between the beginning and the end is unspoken of. It could be smooth as a slide or a roller coaster ride.For her, it was both.
Delhi, the city of her dreams and envious looks but also what she had not dreamt of. During the course of a promising job, Akansha came across Anna&#39;s movement. Influenced by the ideology , she decided to be a part of it.Little had she known that this would change her life completely. From a smooth slide her life would become a roller coaster ride. When as a journalist , she meets a prominent -figure of the Anna Movement and inspired as she&#39;s, She wonders if it is her job that she wants to pursue.Self introspection makes her quit her job and becoming a full time social activist will be to meet her first rejection.
                                                                    Sunny, the guy she casually got acquainted to and as casually started talking to and as very casually got rejected by.He was the first guy she was ever attracted. He headed the NGO, she worked for..His rejection made her cynical and paranoid beyond limits.It was tough to move on. But this was not the only concern in her life. There was also the wrath of a politician she had ignited which made her life no less than hell. She lost her mental stableness under constant death threats..It was around this time that her family back in her hometown Bhopal got to know of her political associations. Her Annie troubled them too.
That was a phase and it passed like all good and bad phases. If winter has come, can spring be far behind?
The organisation which took her peace away also gave her the love of life. A software engineer she met was of the very same organisation and it took both of them just two months to realize she had to tie nuptial knot. Despite the opposition of the families they got married as the story unfolds" />
