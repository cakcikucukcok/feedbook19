  <title>The Bishop Wears No Drawers: A Former Catholic Missionary Priest Remembers Africa - Michael Barrington</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this spellbinding and riveting memoir, Barrington provides a brutally honest and gripping portrayal of his life as a young missionary priest. A racist alcoholic pastor nurses him through his first bout of malaria fever. Stood up to be shot by a group of drunken soldiers, a whiskey-drinking &quot;John Wayne type&quot; priest then shows real caring. Devastated by the death of a twelve years old school girl he was mentoring, he then has to bury her.   Set during a pivotal period in the history of the Catholic church and bloody civil war in Nigeria, The Bishop Wears No Drawers is a true-to-life &quot;survivor&quot; tale replete with adrenaline-pumping adventures, daunting challenges and the added dimension of one priest&#39;s profound religious struggle to find his true self.   Combined with warm humor, moving insights and personal testament Barrington offers an unfettered glimpse into the rarely entered domain and closed doors of the highest level of church management." />
