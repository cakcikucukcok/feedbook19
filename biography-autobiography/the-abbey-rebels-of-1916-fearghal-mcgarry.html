  <title>The Abbey Rebels of 1916 - Fearghal McGarry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The story of the 1916 Easter Rising and its aftermath from a new persepective&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Abbey Theatre played a leading role in the politicisation of the revolutionary generation that won Irish freedom, but comparatively little is known about the men and women who formed the lifeblood of the institution: those whose radical politics drove them to fight in the 1916 Rising.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drawing on a huge range of previously unpublished material, &lt;i&gt;The Abbey Rebels of 1916&lt;/i&gt; explores the experiences, hopes and dreams of these remarkable but largely forgotten individuals: M&amp;aacute;ire Nic Shiubhlaigh, the Abbey’s first leading lady; Peadar Kearney, author of the national anthem; feminist Helena Molony, the first female political prisoner of her generation; Se&amp;aacute;n Connolly, the first rebel to die in the Rising; carpenter Barney Murphy; usherette Ellen Bushell; and Hollywood star Arthur Shields.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Invigorating and provocative, this is the story of how, in the years following the Easter Rising, the radical ideals that inspired their revolution were gradually supplanted by a conservative vision of the nation Ireland would become. Lavishly illustrated with 200 documents and images, it provides a fresh and compelling account of the Rising and its aftermath.&lt;/p&gt;" />
