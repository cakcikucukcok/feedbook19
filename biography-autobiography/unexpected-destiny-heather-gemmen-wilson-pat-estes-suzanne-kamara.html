  <title>Unexpected Destiny - Heather Gemmen Wilson, Pat Estes, Suzanne Kamara</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Who is Suzanne?&lt;br&gt;
 A premature newborn whose mother has just died&lt;br&gt;
 A delightful toddler who doesnt know a stranger&lt;br&gt;
 A worried student who avoids wearing thick glasses to escape negative peer comments&lt;br&gt;
 A loving preadolescent who cares very much for her companions&lt;br&gt;
 A confused teenager in crisis over identity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since starting school, Suzanne has felt different from all her acquaintances. She claims to be mad at God for her appearance. Her adoptive mother relates the tumult of emotions for Suzanne and her family as she seeks to decipher her racial, cultural, and familial identity while dealing with albinism and adoption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her journey leads to her birth-family, their unfamiliar culture, and the African village of her roots. Although hard to see in the midst of the struggle, the hand of God is guiding and protecting His beloved child while working behind the scenes to bring her dreams to fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;" />
