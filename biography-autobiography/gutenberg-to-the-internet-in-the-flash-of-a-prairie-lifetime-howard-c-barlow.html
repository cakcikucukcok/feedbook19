  <title>Gutenberg to the Internet.in the Flash of a Prairie Lifetime - Howard C Barlow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From Gutenberg to the Internet &lt;/em&gt;is only one story in this book. This is a story of this pivot point for many people who, like me, lived through the changes and challenges of this transitional era in the newspaper and printing industries in the United States. I, like many others, grew to love the smells and sounds of the printing field. I hope that my telling of experiences in a small town newspaper and in letterpress printing may resonate with others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to the Prairie Town that Raised Me,&lt;/em&gt; is a memoir of the small town life I experienced growing up in the late 30&amp;rsquo;s to the early 50&amp;rsquo;s in a little town on the prairie of South Dakota. It is a tribute to the many wonderful caring people that inhabit small town communities. I suspect it will trigger memories in others who have experienced the goodness of small town living and many who still enjoy the rich small town life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Tale of Strong Norwegian Women&lt;/em&gt; and several other stories in this section, connect to our family&amp;rsquo;s Norwegian ancestry. My grandmother came to South Dakota from Nordra Osen, Osterdahlen, Norway with her mother and four sisters. They all settled in the Lake Preston, SD area in late 1892. The stories in this section emphasize our family&amp;rsquo;s Norse connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Special Family Stories &lt;/em&gt;is a group of short stories of family members, incidents and events that may trigger memories of the readers own family and good times. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leftovers too good to leave out.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/em&gt;I hope you, dear reader, enjoy these short pieces. Be sure to read the last story about my, frisky, effervescent mother-in-law and her wily but always forgivable ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
