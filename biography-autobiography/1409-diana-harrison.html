      <meta name="description" content="November 29th 1969 a cold and windy night a mother and her nine months old son in arms walking to find a place to call home. Not really late just dusk dark. Wanted to get back to my one room that I was renting didnt want my son to get too cold. Holding him and talking he was smiling at me. He seems to be saying mommy it will be alright. I had to find a home for us. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I must have walked what seems like miles but really only four blocks but 
they were long blocks. I didnt really know which, way to go just walking. God must have heard my prayers or my sons smiles you know God watches out for fools and babies. I was only eighteen myself and had a son he was just about a year a baby raising a baby. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Hes getting cranky now wanting to cry and move all around dropping his 
bottle on the ground I stopped to pick it up and wipe it off looked towards this light that was very bright because now it getting darker outside. Where is this light coming from I can really see 1409. My new home a large sign
