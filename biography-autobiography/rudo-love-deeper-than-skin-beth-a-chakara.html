  <title>Rudo (Love): Deeper Than Skin - Beth A. Chakara</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In a story that spans years and continents, the author takes the reader on a journey that evokes feelings of elation as well as sadness. This book shows how the power of love transcends race, language, and culture. The author delves into the challenges and blessings of friendship and love in face of adversity; she helps the reader appreciate the double-sided experience of following ones heart in the face of discrimination and support from the faith community. She shares her husbands story of growing up in Zimbabwe, Africa, and how God paved a way for him to study in the United States. This book also includes their personal story of overcoming racial and cultural barriers in their relationship. With the blending of her husbands African heritage and her Amish roots, this story proves that love is deeper than skin.&lt;/p&gt;" />
