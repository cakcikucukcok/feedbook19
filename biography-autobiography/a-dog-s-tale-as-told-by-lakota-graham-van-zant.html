  <title>A Dog’S Tale as Told by Lakota - Graham Van Zant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I have written this book from the viewpoint of one who has lived with and loved dogs since being a very young child. We had everything from springer spaniels to a big Newfoundlander. When I moved out on my own, I lived mainly in large cities, so I lived for many years not having a dog. When we bought our place in Hesperia with a large fenced-in yard, I knew it was time again to have a dog.
I have been very spiritually oriented from early childhood and all through my adult life. As a young person, I had a very profound spiritual experience, and it changed my viewpoint on life very dramatically.
In the book you will see how the spirit world seemed to intervene to bring about the relationship that has developed between my wife and me with our friend Lakota. Of all the dogs I have ever known, this one is the most unique and special.
I started to write this book several years ago, and it just stalled. Recently I had another spiritual experience, and the doorway was opened again. The tale flowed freely from Lakota, and here we are with her story. It has been a joy to put it down in words in this book. I hope you enjoy it as much as I had fun in writing it." />
