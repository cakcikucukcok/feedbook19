  <title>Diana vs. Charles - James Whitaker, Christopher Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The explosive love story and full details behind Diana and Charles&#39;s relationship have never been revealed ... until now. Their breakup sent shock waves around the world, as growing suspicions were officially confirmed: Their fairy-tale marriage was just that - a fairy tale. Not only was the lily-white veil stripped away from their private lives, but the British monarchy itself was suddenly under scathing scrutiny. After all the headlines, the whispers, the rumors, the damaging claims and counterclaims by intimate friends of each, the full inside story of Diana, Charles, and their doomed union is now revealed - by the one person uniquely qualified to tell the lurid and fascinating tale of royal romance, rivalry, and scandal.
James Whitaker is famous in England as the authority on the Royal Family - the only journalist to have had access to all the members of the House of Windsor for more than two decades of exclusive reportage. At the same time, he knew the teenage Lady Diana Spencer long before the royal wedding bells.
With vivid personality profiles of an awe-inspiring gallery of characters, with unblushing and authentic depictions of how the Royals live and love, with utter honesty about both the monarchy and the girl now exiled from its charmed circle, Diana vs. Charles offers the most staggering, far-reaching disclosures about the greatest personal crisis ever to shake the Royal Family." />
