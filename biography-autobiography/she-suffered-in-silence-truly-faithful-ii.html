  <title>She Suffered in Silence - Truly Faithful Ii</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is an inspiring true story
I was molested as a child and, later on, raped as a teenager and as an adult. Life is not safe, nor is it easy for children or adults, but I thank God Im still here, singing and giving Him praise for his goodness. I could have been dead and gone, but God has a plan for my life. 
It was a blessing for me to be able to write this book. I thank God for keeping me through it all. He blessed me to write this book as an example to other young women everywhere. Because I didnt know the Lord for myself, I made a lot of wrong choices in my life. I went about doing what I thought was right, looking for love in all the wrong places, trying to find peace for my soul, but I was running so fast I ran right into evil everywhere I went. 
I want to encourage you to seek God first in your life, and he will direct your past. Call on the name of Jesus, our Lord and Savior. The way to seek Him is to read and study the Bible daily, starting with the Ten Commandments. The book of Proverbs tells us how we should live and not live, for His Word is our everyday instructions, if we listen to what He is telling us. Get to know God for yourself. 
Mothers and fathers, teach your children the ways of God. Proverbs 22:6 says, Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old, he will not depart from it. Isaiah 54:13 says, And all thy children shall be taught of the Lord; and great shall be the peace of thy children. 
The Word tells us that we are born into a world of sin, but God does not intend for us to stay in sin. He is giving us a choice to change and do right for eternal life or to continue in evil and burn in the lake of fire forever. A child should never have to go through abuse of any kind in life, but it exists more often than not. It is the parents job to teach and protect their children by teaching them to speak up and speak out against the evil one and that its all right to say no so they wont make the wrong choices in their lives. 
Ladies, we have to be careful of whom we leave our children with or whom we bring into our home and with our children. Evil is everywhere. There are all kinds of people in this world. Children are being molested or killed every day at the hands of a friend, stranger, boyfriend, uncle, cousin, father, brotherthe list goes on! 
God said to trust no man. Man will continue to molest children as long as he can get away with it. If a person molests you, more than likely he has and will molest someone else. The cycle continues unless theyre stopped. The enemy wants to steal, kill, and destroy us because of the plan God has for our lives. 
The devil wants to destroy our children, to keep them from getting to where God wants them to be. I seek ed after the Lord for myself, and I found Him. What I didnt know was, through it all, he was keeping me. Its all a test to see where your faith lies in Christ Jesus. 
Lord I just want to thank You!" />
