  <title>Women of Courage - Katherine Martin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The 41 ordinary and well-known women honored in this first book in New World Library&#39;s &quot;People Who Dare&quot; series have shown forms of bravery that, according to editor Martin, go largely unrecognized — such as persevering in adverse circumstances, challenging tradition, showing vulnerability, fostering healing, and listening to one&#39;s heart.
Concern about her children&#39;s education impelled Patty Murray (currently U.S. Senator from Washington) to run against an incumbent and win a seat in her state senate. Acting out of a deeply felt commitment to the poor, Dr. Janelle Goetcheus, along with other physicians she recruited, founded Christ House, a renovated apartment building where seriously ill homeless patients stay and receive care.
After she was diagnosed with breast cancer, Laura Evans celebrated her survival by founding Expedition Inspiration, an organization that takes breast cancer survivors on mountain climbs.
Cora Lee Johnson&#39;s longtime dream of starting a community sewing center became a reality when she was 62 because, although poor and uneducated, she persevered by talking about the center to anyone who would listen. Men and women both will find inspiration for their own lives in these captivating stories." />
