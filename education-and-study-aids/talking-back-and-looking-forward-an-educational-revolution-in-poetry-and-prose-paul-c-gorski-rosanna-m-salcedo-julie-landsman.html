They set out to collect writing about people&amp;rsquo;s experiences--their reflections on social justice and injustice, equity and inequity in and out of schools that influence educational access and opportunity. By sharing stories in poetry and prose and photography, telling truths either as people on the margins or as their partners in struggles for educational justice, it is the editors intentions to expand the narrative of the educational policy and practice. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
