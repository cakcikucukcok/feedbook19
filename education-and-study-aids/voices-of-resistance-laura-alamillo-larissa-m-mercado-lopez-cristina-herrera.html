  <title>Voices of Resistance - Laura Alamillo, Larissa M. Mercado-Lopez, Cristina Herrera</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The banning of Mexican-American Studies and censorship of Chican@-authored books in Arizona were part of a succession of anti-Mexican and anti-Chican@ policies that were enacted across the state and in the education system. The counterstories offered through these classes and literature not only created a sense of cultural inclusion, but ignited a political and activist consciousness among the mostly Chican@ youth, and reinvigorated conversations among educators about the teaching of race, ethnicity, and culture in the classroom, particularly through youth literature. While most work on youth literature has emphasized &amp;ldquo;multicultural&amp;rdquo; literature as a means of being inclusive, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Voices of Resistance: Interdisciplinary Approaches to Chican@ Children&amp;rsquo;s Literature&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; recognizes that our present moment--one that is rife with continued anti-Mexican sentiment but that has given rise to our first Chicano National Poet Laureate--demands a more focused study of children&amp;rsquo;s and young adult literature by and about Chican@s. This collection re-examines how we view multicultural and diversity literature and recognize literature that invites social transformation. Using multi- and interdisciplinary perspectives to critically examine a wide range of Chican@ children&amp;rsquo;s pictures book and young adult novels, this collection reaffirms Chicano@ children&amp;rsquo;s literature as a means to achieve equity and social change.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
