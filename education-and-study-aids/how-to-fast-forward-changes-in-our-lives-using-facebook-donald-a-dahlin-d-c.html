  <title>How to “Fast-Forward” Changes in Our Lives Using Facebook - Donald A. Dahlin D.C.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Can We Restore American Standards?
The truth is  America has been systematically corrupted by several past Governments; there  are Valid DVDS by PBS and other sources that you will find in this book to explain how this came about.
But, it goes much earlier than that! It goes back into the 1800s when Thinking men considered ancient beliefs of the Veda, Buddhism, Jesus Christ: saving our souls, and Darwins Evolution, - trying to confront Reality.
Germany: a forerunner in science, had Wilhelm Wundt a psychologist and a leader with a new understanding of the reality of Darwin and evolution declared in a party of interested persons that Man is only an animal and has no soul that can be demonstrated; the same with God and Religion; both of them are the myths of the old people; man is an evolved chimpanzee and should be treated like an animal with a brain and nervous system, and to be observed for abnormal behavior and treated as such.
	Russian observers agreed and together with Germany formed the National Education (NEA) of teachers, and the birth of psychiatry.
	There is more but it is in my book, and the source is a well-distinguished school teacher: Samuel L.Blumenfeld and author of:
N.E.A. Trojan Horse in American Education  The First Full-Length Expose of The National Education Association.  1949-1984.
Since then, American psychiatry has invaded our schools,  colleges,  universities, State and Federal Governments and you will learn how and what they did to our Country.
They have sought to destroy  our education, religion, morals, field of medicine, the laws and our courtsand today we have illiteracy, mental illness, drug addiction, adultery, living together without marriage (responsibility), prostitution, mass shootings of family, teachers and friends, and often themselves. And etc.
Again, I repeat:
Can We Restore American Standards?
If I provide you with all the tools or rsources that wlll help you do the job  would you be willing to become a Problem Solver?
A person desiring to be a Problem Solver would be dealing with his/her environment with one or more persons and also promoting the IDEA through his/her Facebook connections  so it could become world-wideperhaps like telepathy.
But, read the two pages of the Contents and see for yourself the huge scope of help you will receive for common problems of illiteracy, what causes disease, how to attain optimum health and happiness.
The persons you help, your children, and their future generations will all appreciate your help.
So will I." />
