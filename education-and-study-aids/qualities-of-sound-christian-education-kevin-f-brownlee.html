  <title>Qualities of Sound Christian Education - Kevin F. Brownlee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Christian educators: What does God require of teachers? Are you integrating Gods Word into every subject taught? Are you training your students heart, and do you know how to teach honorable character, self-discipline, and godly decision making?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Christian school trustees: Do you know Gods criteria when hiring teachers or administrators? Are your schools policies, statement of faith, and curricula based on sound biblical doctrine? Do you know what that doctrine is? Do you know how to recognize and battle attacks from the enemies of your school? Would you like advice and suggestions on fundraising?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Christian parents: Do you know what to look for when choosing a Christian school? Are you holding your childrens school accountable to what God requires? Is the school teaching the truth? Can you distinguish truth from error?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Christian homeschoolers: Are you obedient to Gods education requirements? Do you know how to choose curricula with godly principles? Are you effectively training your children for lives of serving and glorifying God in whatever they do?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for answers to any of the above, then this book is for you!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Titus 2:1 says to teach what is in accord with sound teachings. In this book, Christian school trustee Kevin F. Brownlee unpacks the word sound and explains Gods requirements for educating precious children in a commonsense style that will enlighten educators and parents, and invigorate Christian education.&lt;/p&gt;" />
