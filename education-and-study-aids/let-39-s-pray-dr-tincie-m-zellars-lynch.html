  <title>Let&#39;s Pray - Dr. Tincie M. Zellars Lynch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I know you can look on your book shelf and count the numerous journals, books, and magazines instructing you how to pray.  That is why I took my time to birth this journal so that it wouldnt be just another book in your library.  One morning during my personal time with God I heard him say Now is the time to give birth to what I have placed in you for others regarding prayer. 
 	I called my sister and informed her I was instructed to author this journal NOW. Thank God she was willing to listen and agreed to assist me by producing this journal with me with the guidance of the Holy Spirit.  So thus the work begins.
	By utilizing this journal you should expect your life to be tremendously changed by accessing the throne of God through prayer and meditation.  Expect your prayers to be answered by activating your faith when you pray knowing that God is a rewarder to those that diligently seek Him.  You should have a clear understanding how powerful prayer can be when utilizing the four stage process of prayer outlined in this journal. 
	In most journals youll find that when recording there is a set pattern that you should follow.  What makes this journal different is that you can record any time that you feel there is a need to record your most precious thoughts after praying.  
	I believe that this journal/work book will be a valuable asset to those starting, advancing and renewing their prayer life with the Lord.
	Thank you for taking the challenge to learn a new method of going beyond the Vail in prayer." />
