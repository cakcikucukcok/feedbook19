  <title>The 20Th Century . . . the Real Truth - Robert Hubschman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Just imagine being a sixteen-year-old child in 1900, compared to a sixteen year-old child in 2000, and the advancements that resulted in changes not only in the United States but the entire world. Most history books are slanted, depending not only on what country you are from but also on the geographic location in some countries, especially in the United States.
One cannot help but admire all the advancements in such a short time span in the twentieth century in comparison to the rest of the advancements that took place throughout human historythe span of time that took us from the horse to the horseless carriage and beyond. What must have seemed to be science fiction in 1900 is our reality today. The one lost concept seems to revolve around God and religion. There are extremists in both the right and the left, with the minority either killing in his name or trying to take him out of our culture completely. No matter who we refer to him as, he cannot be happy with the mess we made of this world and his many gifts.
What about our future?" />
