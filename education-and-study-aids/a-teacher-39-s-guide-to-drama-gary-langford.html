  <title>A Teacher&#39;s Guide to Drama - Gary Langford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Gary Langford is the author of 33 books, including 2 previous textbooks, reflecting his talent as a teacher writer. The others are 10 novels, such as Vanities (Macmillan), Newlands (Penguin) and Sohrab (Amazon Kindle), 14 books of poetry, including The Sonnets of Gary Langford as his 14th collection, and 4 collections of his short stories. He has also written 5 musicals in the period he founded and ran a theatre, The Playhouse, at what was then the Macarthur College of Advanced Education, Sydney. In this period he directed around 75 shows, many of which he wrote. He was also the director of shows that toured schools, utilizing puppets, along with revues that played to schools, whether in a school hall or outside. A Teachers Guide to Drama grew from drama subjects he founded and ran, including Oral Communication, Drama in the Classroom, Childrens Theatre and Puppetry, along with Writing and Performance that culminated in shows that also toured schools, notably high schools in the south-west of Sydney. A key to open the door for you is his teacher writer background enabling him to try all the exercises that you will find in here. Some are old and traditional, others he originated and used in drama workshops that he ran. Rest assured, there will be something for you in this practical and amusing textbook.&lt;/p&gt;
