  <title>The Journey of an Immigrant - Khetam Dahi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Khetam Dahi captures the often-ignored voices and painful experiences of Syrian migrant children and families. In a simple yet honest and powerful prose, Dahi, through the eyes a child turning adolescent, narrates the everyday existence of immigrant and working-class families. Although the family faced extreme hardships and poverty, their love for each other and determination to succeed served as a catalyst to infuse them with optimism and a love for life. Her inspirational journey of breaking through despite all obstacles certainly lets readers vicariously experience her joy and sorrow, regrets and hopes. Dahis artfully weaved narratives provide young adult learners an opportunity to become personally enmeshed in her stories, but most importantly, it creates a space where students can feel free to relate, relive, and learn. The simple language makes this book an excellent choice for reluctant readers and ESL students, especially because the author includes many exercises to give students the opportunity to share their own experiences and identify with the characters in her stories." />
