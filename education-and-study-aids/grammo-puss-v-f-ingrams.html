  <title>Grammo-Puss - V.F. Ingrams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book was written in an effort to rescue the English Language. This lovely 
language of ours seems to be on the decline, as we strive hard to reflect our 
multi-cultural society. I feel that whilst this is a good thing, the onus is on us 
to ensure that we do not sink to a lower level of speaking, but rather, try to 
encourage people to speak our language properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is aimed at Primary and Secondary Schools, English Language 
Schools, Universities, Teachers&#39; Training Colleges, Editors, News Readers, 
Television Broadcasters, and Proof Readers. It deals with the most common 
grammatical errors and offers simple corrections in an effort to stamp this out. 
I hope that my book does not offend anyone, but that those who read it, will join 
me in this brave effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks go to my dear friend, Wendy James, a brilliant and budding Artist, for 
providing the artwork for the cover of the book. &lt;/p&gt;" />
