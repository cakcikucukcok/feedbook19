  <title>Think Outside the Gate - Melisa Mel, Kendall Pardo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Think Outside the Gate is a book dedicated to all those who work or live in any type of incarceration environment. It contains a compilation of lesson plans and presentation outlines which can be used as an example of how one can turn any type of lesson into a think outside the gate experience. 
The think outside the gate mind-set is a philosophy that Melisa Mel created as the focal point of her lessons and presentations. This approach makes it a priority to keep the students focus on everything and anything outside of their limited, incarcerating walls. This not only instills hope in them, but it also better prepares them for when they cross the prison gates to go live back in society.
Melisa Mel feels that better preparing for reentry into society is the most efficient way to ensure a persons success outside of prison so that they do not return to prison. Her hope is that while working or living behind bars, a think outside the gate mind-set is present at all times, as that will tackle recidivism at its very core." />
