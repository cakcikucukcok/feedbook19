  <title>In the Eyes of God - William S. Ponder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;In the Eyes of God&lt;/i&gt; takes a hard look at what is being done to improve public education in America. The twenty-first century finds the United States in a very demanding situation regarding the economy, world affairs, and the general demise of humanity. The education of children in America seems to be the one topic that is getting some attention. With documentaries like &lt;i&gt;The Lottery&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Waiting for Superman&lt;/i&gt;, the general public is finally beginning to understand the current state of education in the countrya state of which most educators have long been aware.&lt;p&gt;
There is a real lack of leadership in education today and a real fear of doing anything outside the norm in terms of how students learn. The poor selection and retention of talent in the classroom has taken a toll on the ability of
schools to educate their students effectively. &lt;i&gt;In the Eyes of God&lt;/i&gt; challenges the fact
that only a small percentage of the school day to used to educate children. It also examines cultural profi ciency and the need for educators to go beyond just cultural awareness and become more competent and profi cient teachers. Most importantly, we must strive to see that no children fall through the cracks of
the system and that every child receives the best education possible." />
