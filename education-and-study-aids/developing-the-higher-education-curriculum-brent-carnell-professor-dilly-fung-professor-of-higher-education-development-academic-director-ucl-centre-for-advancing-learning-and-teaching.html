  <title>Developing the Higher Education Curriculum - Brent Carnell, Professor Dilly Fung, Professor of Higher Education Development &amp; Academic Director Ucl Centre for Advancing Learning and Teaching</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A
complementary volume to Dilly Fung’s &lt;i&gt;A Connected Curriculum for Higher Education&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;(2017), this book explores ‘research-based education’ as applied in
practice within the higher education sector. A collection of 15 chapters followed
by illustrative vignettes, it showcases approaches to engaging students
actively with research and enquiry across disciplines. It begins with one
institution’s creative approach to research-based education – UCL’s Connected
Curriculum, a conceptual framework for integrating research-based education
into all taught programmes of study – and branches out to show how aspects of the
framework can apply to practice across a variety of institutions in a range of
national settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 15 chapters are provided
by a diverse range of authors who all explore research-based education in their
own way. Some chapters are firmly based in a subject-discipline – including art
history, biochemistry, education, engineering, fashion and design, healthcare,
and veterinary sciences – while others reach across geopolitical regions, such
as Australia, Canada, China, England, Scotland and South Africa. The final chapter offers 12 short vignettes
of practice to highlight how engaging students with research and enquiry can
enrich their learning experiences, preparing them not only for more advanced
academic learning, but also for professional roles in complex, rapidly changing
social contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
