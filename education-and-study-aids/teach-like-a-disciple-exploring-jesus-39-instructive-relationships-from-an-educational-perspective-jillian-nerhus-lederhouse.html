  <title>Teach Like a Disciple: Exploring Jesus&#39; Instructive Relationships from an Educational Perspective - Jillian Nerhus Lederhouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Although much has been written about P-12 teaching from a biblical perspective, this study focuses on Christ&#39;s relationships with a diverse group of individuals: wealthy and poor, women and men, unschooled and well-educated, loud and quiet, influential and powerless, those whom Jesus knew well and those who were strangers to him, those of his own faith and culture as well as those outside of it. These individuals are remarkably similar to the students we teach in our public and private school classrooms today. Each interaction between Jesus and an individual focuses on what we can learn from the student and Jesus as well as what we, as teachers, can apply in our profession. As in our own practice, some students learned their lessons well; others failed. For some, we are uncertain when or if they achieved Jesus&#39; objective for them.  Whether we are novices or experienced educators, we can learn through these instructive relationships how to be teachers who follow Jesus&#39; example in seeing our students&#39; potential, holistically caring for them, and ultimately having a positive impact on their lives. Through exploring these biblical relationships, we can gain a better understanding of how to teach like Christ&#39;s disciple." />
