  <title>I Am Me - Marlene Ringler, PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;li&gt;Estimates suggest that 50,000 autistic children will enter adulthood each year creating what has been called a “tsunami”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Books dealing with the future needs of the autistic adult are unavailable or speculative at best. Issues such as the medical, residential, and occupational requirements of this population are seldom considered in the literature on autism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since the subject is of universal interest, it has the potential for foreign-rights sales and promotion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Features an up-to-date review of respected research into autism focusing on treatment interventions, medical therapies, and diagnostic trends with a unique focus on the autistic adult&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Examines available global data about the state of autistic adults, including diagnosis, medications, therapies, and treatment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Presents a clear and concise overview of the history of autism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports, guides, and encourages parents and caregivers as they make important decisions regarding the future of their autistic child&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gives families a platform from which to advocate, support, and accept their autistic family member&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to a survey by Goodreads, 2015, the number of fiction and non-fiction books written on the subject of autism was nearly 1000 and this trend has continued as global awareness of autism increases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initiatives, such as World Autism Awareness Week, growth in the establishment of charities in the US and internationally which focus on autism issues, and the trend of readers eager to learn more about the subject of autism have gained momentum&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the last 10 years, over 10,000 journal articles were published on the subject of autism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over 20 organizations, societies, and institutions in the US alone were buying and selling books on autism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nearly 1.5% of the global population of children each year are being diagnosed as having an autism spectrum disorder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Approximately 34% of those on the autism spectrum are entering universities and colleges and little has been written about the unique needs of this population. I Am Me is positioned to address the challenges of this young adult population&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crossover potential exists as books on autism subjects can be viewed across the readership among those interested in psychology, disabilities, parenting, spirituality, faith-based works, abnormal behavior, medicine, education, and health&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Popular and increased interest in the subject of autism is easily identifiable due to the increase in the number of venues addressing the spectrum such as popular TV programs (Big Bang Theory), films (Rain Man and the Accountant ), and social media groups in Facebook and Google. Books about autism continue to appear because people continue to buy them&lt;/li&gt;" />
