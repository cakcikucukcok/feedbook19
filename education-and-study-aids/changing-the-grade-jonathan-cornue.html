  <title>Changing the Grade - Jonathan Cornue</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Many educators agree that the 100-point grading model is not always a reliable way to evaluate student learning. But is there another way to more accurately and equitably grade students and provide high-quality information to parents while fostering student learning? If so, why haven&#39;t school districts across the country changed their practices?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Changing the Grade&lt;/em&gt;, author and educator Jonathan Cornue presents a detailed model for developing a more reliable, standards-based grading system&amp;mdash;&lt;em&gt;including 30 steps to guide you through the process&lt;/em&gt;. In addition to identifying and addressing the barriers to change&amp;mdash;such as concerns about how colleges and employers will interpret an alternative grading model&amp;mdash;Cornue offers a concrete structure for changing the grading system, providing guidance on:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thinking in a new way about &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; grades are given and the &lt;em&gt;purpose&lt;/em&gt;  of a report card grade;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Identifying what needs to be changed and what actions must be taken to facilitate the change;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Building a team of stakeholders&amp;mdash;including teachers, principals, and guidance counselors&amp;mdash;to lead the change process;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Developing the new standards-based grading structure;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Designing standards-based assignments and assessments that align with a new grading structure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoiding grade inflation; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Getting buy-in from teachers and other staff members, principals, administrators, the board of education, and the community by demonstrating that the change process is intentional, research-based, student-focused, and permanent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book also includes helpful samples of standards-based gradebooks, homework assignments, rubrics, and report cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in making a systemic and systematic shift to a high-quality grading structure that is far less subjective than many commonly found in schools, consider &lt;em&gt;Changing the Grade&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
