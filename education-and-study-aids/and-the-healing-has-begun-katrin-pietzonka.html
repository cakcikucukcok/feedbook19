  <title>And the Healing Has Begun... - Katrin Pietzonka</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For anyone interested in Northern Ireland, its history, its culture, its music....
finally here comes a book that offers a new approach into understanding the
complex diversity that has shaped Northern Irish society and its people during
the times of the Troubles and beyond. Like poems, songs, in their own right,
should be recognised as historical documents. From Mickey McConnells Only our
Rivers Run Free and Phil Coulter The Town I loved so Well to Tommy Sands There
Were Roses - political &amp; social developments inspired Northern Irish poets and
songwriters alike. By incorporating a great amount of background information
on the artists mentioned above and resulting from personal interviews with the
author a very unique insight into the history of Northern Ireland is given.
In addition, the vast amount of songs written from an outsiders perspective and
in particular in the Rock and Popmusic Genre such as Paul McCartneys Give
Ireland back to the Irish, John Lennons Sunday, Bloody Sunday to James Taylors
Belfast to Boston and Katie Meluas Belfast, also required appropriate recognition.
Together, all these songs compiled and discussed in this book will provide the
reader with a better understanding of Northern Irelands history, its society, its
people past and present.
Whether it is for further academic research or simply used as reference material
for anyone interested in Irish Music and Songs about and from Northern Ireland,
this book will remain an essential guide and reference book in years to come." />
