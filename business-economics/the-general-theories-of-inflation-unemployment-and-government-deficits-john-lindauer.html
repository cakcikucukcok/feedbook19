  <title>The General Theories of Inflation, Unemployment, and Government Deficits - John Lindauer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Intellectual time lags exist in every field of science.  So it is that even today one often hears the same old common knowledge nonsense and simplistic analysis from the early post-Keynesian era when students learned about some of the monetary and fiscal policies applicable to the U.K. and its institutions (Keynes) on the premise that they are also applicable to the U.S.   Many are not.  The result has all too often been inflation or massive unemployment that continues even though it could be quickly ended without fiscal changes or new laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a re-presentation of Professor Lindauers early ground-breaking work from the 1960s. It explains why not all Keynesian and neo-classical theory and monetary and fiscal policies are applicable to the unique structure and institutions of the United States and how the current United States malaise can be quickly ended - via a new approach to monetary policy, long ago explained by Lindauer and adopted by other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was while at Claremont as professor of economics that Lindauer first modeled the concept of aggregate supply and related it with the concept of aggregate demand to develop many of the macroeconomic theories presented herein and integrate them into the then-existing theories of inflation and unemployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly in these days of high unemployment, the unique and quickly effective monetary policies he suggested years ago to end recessions and depressions without causing inflation or exacerbating government deficits are today immediately available without requiring fiscal changes or the passage of new laws and regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Lindauers other publications include Land Taxation and Indian Economic Development (with Sarjit Singh); various editions of his &lt;i&gt;Macroeconomics&lt;/i&gt; series; and his early ground-breaking journal articles such as &lt;i&gt;Stabilization Inflation and the Inflation-Unemployment Trade-off.&lt;/i&gt;  A non-technical version of this work is available as &lt;i&gt;Inflations, Unemployment, and Government Deficits: End Them&lt;/i&gt;.  It is suitable for journalists, laymen, and lawyers serving as Federal Reserve governors.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Lindauers books have been translated into Japanese, Spanish, Portugese, Korean, Hindi, and Chinese and the policies his theories suggest implemented by central banks around the world.  He has additionally served as a visiting professor at Sussex University, the University of California (SD), and Punjab University.  He lives in Scottsdale and Chicago.  His teaching is limited to lectures and visiting professorships.&lt;/p&gt;" />
