  <title>With God on Our Side - Adam D. Reich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;When unions undertake labor organizing campaigns, they often do so from strong moral positions, contrasting workers&#39; rights to decent pay or better working conditions with the more venal financial motives of management. But how does labor confront management when management itself has moral legitimacy? In &lt;em&gt;With God on Our Side&lt;/em&gt;, Adam D. Reich tells the story of a five-year campaign to unionize Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital, a Catholic hospital in California. Based on his own work as a volunteer organizer with the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), Reich explores how both union leaders and hospital leaders sought to show they were upholding the Catholic &quot;mission&quot; of the hospital against a market represented by the other. Ultimately, workers and union leaders were able to reinterpret Catholic values in ways that supported their efforts to organize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;More generally, Reich argues that unions must weave together economic and cultural power in order to ensure their continued relevancy in the postindustrial world. In addition to advocating for workers&#39; economic interests, unions must engage with workers&#39; emotional investments in their work, must contend with the kind of moral authority that Santa Rosa Hospital leaders exerted to dissuade workers from organizing, and must connect labor&#39;s project to broader conceptions of the public good.&lt;/p&gt;" />
