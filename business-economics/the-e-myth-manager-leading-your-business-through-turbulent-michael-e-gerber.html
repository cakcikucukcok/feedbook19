  <title>The E-Myth Manager: Leading Your Business Through Turbulent - Michael E. Gerber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;More than ten years after his first bestselling book&amp;#44; The E&amp;#45;Myth&amp;#44; changed the lives of hundreds of thousands of small business owners&amp;#44; Michael Gerber&amp;#26926;trepreneur&amp;#44; author&amp;#44; and speaker extraordinaire&amp;#26985;res the next salvo in his highly successful E&amp;#45;Myth Revolution. Drawing on lessons learned from working with more than 15&amp;#44;000 small&amp;#44; medium&amp;#45;sized&amp;#44; and very large organisations&amp;#44; Gerber has discovered the truth behind why management doesn&amp;#8242;t work and what to do about it. Unearthing the arbitrary origins of commonly held doctrines such as the omniscience of leader (Emperor) and the most widely embraced myth of all&amp;#25832;e E&amp;#45;Myth Manager offers a fresh&amp;#44; provocative alternative to management as we know it. It explores why every manager must take charge of his own life&amp;#44; reconcile his own personal vision with that of the organisation&amp;#44; and develop an entrepreneurial mind&amp;#45;set to achieve true success. &lt;/p&gt;" />
