  <title>Building a Winning Sales Management Team: The Force Behind the Sales Force - Andris A Zoltners, Prabhakant Sinha, Sally E Lorimer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="First-line sales managers (FLMs) play a key role in helping a sales organization drive profitable revenue growth in an ever-changing business environment. But although directly responsible for managing and driving sales force performance, FLMs often don&#39;t get enough time, attention, and resources from sales leaders. &quot;Building a Winning Sales Management Team&quot; shows just how important FLMs are to sales organizations-and what happens when companies underinvest in these key players.   Authors of four previous books on sales management, Zoltners, Sinha and Lorimer show in &quot;Building a Winning Sales Management Team&quot; just how companies can nurture successful FLMs and improve sales force productivity. The book has dozens of real-life examples of how investing in first-line management paid off in a big way. In developing the book, the authors collaborated with leaders from some of the world&#39;s top companies, including Johnson &amp; Johnson, Microsoft Corp, General Electric Co., International Paper Co., ARAMARK Corp., TPG Capital and Novartis. The authors also draw on their cumulative experience as sales and marketing consultants, faculty members at Northwestern University&#39;s Kellogg School of Management, and business speakers and writers to produce fresh, completely original insights on sales force effectiveness.  &quot;Building a Winning Sales Management Team&quot; shows in detail exactly how companies can improve FLM performance. The authors reveal eight key drivers for defining, creating and enabling a successful first-line sales management team, and show how FLMs are critical facilitators of change. The book also includes a self-assessment tool to help organizations determine the right priorities to start improving sales management team performance." />
