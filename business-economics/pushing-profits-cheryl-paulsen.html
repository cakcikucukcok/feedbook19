  <title>Pushing Profits - Cheryl Paulsen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Nearly half a billion smartphones were sold worldwide in 2011 alone. 67 million iPads were purchased in its first two years in the market; thats the largest product launch in history. A platform shift took place in 2011for the first time, sales of smartphones and tablets eclipsed desktop and notebook sales. For the first time since the launch of cell phones, people are spending more time on mobile devicesand using mobile appsthan the desktop platform browsers. People are on the go, and they need technology that keeps up with them. &lt;br /&gt;
I decided to write this book because I have encountered many businesspeople who lack the knowledge and confidence to join the mobile app revolution. In these pages, youll find a wealth of information and step-by-step guidance to move you toward the essential launch of your businesss mobile app. Ive also extended the value you will receive here by providing four additional bonuses on my website, www.thebookonmobileapps.com.&lt;br /&gt;
The Book on Mobile Apps lives up to its name. It truly is the ultimate guide for small businesses. Cheryl Paulsen delivers creative thinking, proven strategies, and vast knowledge about the value of mobile apps for small businesses. Her book is timely, informative, and a must-read for any entrepreneur today.&lt;br /&gt;
