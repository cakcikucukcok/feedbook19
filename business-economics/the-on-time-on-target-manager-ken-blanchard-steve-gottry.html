  <title>The On-Time, On-Target Manager - Ken Blanchard, Steve Gottry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ken Blanchard&#39;s phenomenal bestsellers, such as &lt;em&gt;The One Minute Manager&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Raving Fans&lt;/em&gt;, have made him a globally recognized business legend. Millions look to Blanchard for innovative approaches to management, leadership, customer service, and much more. Now, he has joined with noted business author Steve Gottry to explore one of the most common and insidious problems plaguing the workplace&amp;#8212;procrastination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The On-Time, On-Target Manager&lt;/em&gt; is the story of Bob, a typical middle manager who puts things off to the last minute. As a result, he misses deadlines because his lack of focus causes him to accomplish meaningless tasks before getting to the important things. Like many professionals, Bob rationalizes, justifies, and tries to explain. Luckily, Bob is sent to his company&#39;s CEO&amp;#8212;which stands for &quot;Chief Effectiveness Officer&quot;&amp;#8212;who helps him deal with the three negative side effects of procrastination: lateness, poor work quality, and stress to himself and others. Bob learns how to transform himself from a crisis-prone Last-Minute manager into a productive On-Time, On-Target manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this engaging parable, Blanchard and Gottry offer practical strategies any professional can put into practice to improve his or her performance.&lt;/p&gt;" />
