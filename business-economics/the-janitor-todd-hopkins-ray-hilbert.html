  <title>The Janitor - Todd Hopkins, Ray Hilbert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Do you ever find yourself losing sight of the important things in life-work and stress can become overwhelming at times. Such is the situation where CEO Roger Kimbrough finds himself in this business parable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Janitor&lt;/i&gt; was inspired by Todd Hopkins&#39;s personal experiences of interviewing overqualified retired businessmen for evening shift janitorial positions. Todd&#39;s applicants consistently would say they simply needed something to do. In this fable, janitor Bob Tidwell helps Roger to reevaluate how he is leading his business and his life. Bob&#39;s counsel is based upon six principles that Todd and coauthor Ray Hilbert discovered have the most impact on succeeding in business while holding together a personal life. Their insightful advice is delivered in a real-to-life story that inspires you to find greater fulfillment in your life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like so many CEOs in the corner office, still working when the janitor arrives to do the nightly cleaning, Roger is having a difficult and stressful evening when he spills his guts to the older janitor. As their relationship develops, Bob, a retired businessman, promises help that will turn Roger&#39;s business and personal life around. The story follows not only their weekly meetings at the office but also the application of each principle:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Recharge vs. Discharge&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;View Family as a Blessing, Not a Responsibility&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Pray, Don&#39;t Pout&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Pass It Around&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Don&#39;t Spend, Invest!&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Leave a Legacy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Janitor&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s message will capture your mind and heart; stimulate meaningful, lasting life-changes; and show you how to influence your family, neighbors, and coworkers while experiencing business and life to the fullest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Take a few minutes and devour this little book by Todd Hopkins and Ray Hilbert. It&#39;s going to be a motivational classic, and you&#39;ll be in on the first wave of inspired readers.&quot; - Pat Williams, Senior Vice President, Orlando Magic; and Author, &lt;i&gt;The Warrior Within&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
