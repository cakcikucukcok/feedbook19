  <title>How to Spot the Next Starbucks, Whole Foods, Walmart, or McDonald&#39;s BEFORE Its Shares Explode - Mark Tier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows the basic golden rule of investing: &quot;Buy Low, Sell High,&quot; but how many of us ever really understand the stock market, how to recognize the &quot;next big thing,&quot; and how to capitalize off of it once you do? ...the truth is not many or we&#39;d all be millionaires. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It seems like early investors in big companies like Facebook and Google had to have won the lottery of investing and just gotten really lucky, but there&#39;s more to it than that. There&#39;s a science to the &quot;Next Big Thing&quot; strategy, and Mark Tier understands it. In &lt;i&gt;How to Spot the Next Starbucks, Whole Foods, Walmart, or McDonald&#39;s BEFORE Its Shares Explode,&lt;/i&gt; Tier shows readers that explosive brands like Starbucks, Whole Foods, McDonald&#39;s, and Walmart didn&#39;t become successful on accident. Through in-depth and accessible case studies, Tier pulls back the curtain on the early Key Performance Indicators that each of these major companies showed even at their earliest stages. Once you learn how to recognize these makings of success, you too will be able to spot the next Starbucks.&lt;/p&gt;" />
