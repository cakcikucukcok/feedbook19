  <title>Customer Karma - Arjun Sen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In Arjun Sen&#39;s most recent book, &lt;u&gt;Customer Karma&lt;/u&gt;, &quot;Why stop at a one-night stand when you can have a lifetime relationship with your customer&quot;, he uncovers the blind spots of many well intentioned companies in the customer dating game. Arjun draws upon his broad experience in marketing, branding, and customer relationships to offer impactful customer-centered insights for business professionals of all levels. Arjun successfully piques your curiosity and keeps you coming back for more with his first-hand industry stories that demonstrate the power of genuinely connecting with clients. This book has something in it for anyone who intends to attract and keep customers, or someone who wants to build meaningful customer relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arjun playfully crosses the boundary of polite business correctness to reveal the biggest vulnerability of businesses; not knowing on a personal level anything about customers they are pursuing or specifically what makes them tick. He akins businesses to a dater and parallels the process of courting a date and should be a similar process to courting a customer. He brings tremendous value in his explanations of how to connect with customers in a way that requires awareness and authenticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arjun excels in his ability to shift his perspective, and reframe situations, so that the reader can see things as both the business and the customer. His first-hand experiences are relatable and applicable to seemingly every business. Arjun cleverly examines plausible and real-life business scenarios, through the lens of karma, which he defines as outcomes based on one&#39;s own efforts and actions. The reader is left with a deeper understanding of what works to cultivate lifelong customer relationships, using dating relationships as the litmus test for authenticity and sincerity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customer Karma, is a must-read for any business that wants to attract, effectively serve and retain life-long customers. Good karma is cultivated by heart-felt good action.  When companies genuinely invest in their customers, they are rewarded with good karma of customer loyalty the abundant returns. This formula works with every relationship and in every area of your life. But knowing the formula is not good enough as Arjun emphasizes that Customer Karma is about action, not words. Businesses build good &quot;Customer Karma&quot; only when they actually put their customers first in all their actions.&lt;/p&gt;" />
