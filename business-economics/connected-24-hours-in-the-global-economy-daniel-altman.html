      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What if you could look behind the headlines of the global economy to see how it really worked? Instead of listening to pundits, politicians, and protestors, you could see firsthand how everyone from migrant workers to central bank governors lived their lives.

Daniel Altman takes you on a whirlwind journey through more than a dozen cities, gathering points of view from moguls, ministers, and the men and women on the street. At each stop, you&#39;ll hear how the world&#39;s workers played their parts in the events of a single day. Starting with their stories, related in their own words, you&#39;ll take on pressing questions in new ways: Can poor countries become rich too quickly? Can corruption ever be a good thing? Do companies need crises in order to stay competitive? What determines the global economic pecking order? Most important, you&#39;ll learn how the billions of decisions made by individuals can and do change the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Connected: 24 Hours in the Global Economy &lt;/i&gt;is part travel guide, part owner&#39;s manual--an absorbing, accessible, and essential road map for every citizen of the global economy in the twenty-first century.&lt;/p&gt;" />
