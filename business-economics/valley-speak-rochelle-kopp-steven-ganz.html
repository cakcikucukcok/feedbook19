  <title>Valley Speak - Rochelle Kopp, Steven Ganz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Silicon Valley has a lingo of its own -- from unicorns to pivoting to growth hacking -- that while colorful can also be rather opaque. This is the definitive guide to the unique words used in the Bay Area startup scene, helping everyone from people who want to do business here to those who just want to watch HBO&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Silicon Valley&lt;/em&gt; without being confused. It&amp;#39;s designed to be thorough and accurate while including a touch of humor (because face it, the way people talk in Silicon Valley can often be a bit ridiculous!)&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you&amp;#39;ve wanted a way to break into the exciting conversation that is happening in Silicon Valley, this book is for you. Or if you&amp;#39;re already in Silicon Valley, you may become frustrated when your colleagues in other places just don&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;get&amp;quot; how things are done here and wish you had a handy primer to give them. You may be familiar with some of the terms, but wish that you had a deeper understanding, so that you could use them with more confidence. Valley Speak features the top 100 Silicon Valley words and phrases and will help anyone navigate the Silicon Valley ecosystem like a pro.&lt;/p&gt;" />
