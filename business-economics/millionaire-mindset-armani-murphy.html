  <title>Millionaire Mindset - Armani Murphy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Have you spent your whole life working hard, only to find that your dreams of success always seem to be just beyond your reach?&lt;br /&gt;
Do you put time, effort, and even money into your goals, only to lose your investment time and again?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Do your dreams seem bigger than your abilities?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you&amp;rsquo;re doing your best to reach your goals of wealth and success, but constantly failing, then I have a surprising statement for you: it could be all in your mind!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Our ability to reach our goals is far more than just the physical work and effort that we put into it. 90% of our success is dictated by our attitude towards that success! In order to manifest your goals as realities, it&amp;rsquo;s vital that you learn how to cultivate what I call the &amp;ldquo;millionaire mindset.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s time to make your mind rich first!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In &lt;i&gt;Millionaire Mindset: Simple Habits &amp;amp; Ideas to Manifest An Abundance of Money, Wealth &amp;amp; Success&lt;/i&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ll teach you how to:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Construct your dreams in a tangible way so you can work towards fulfilling them&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Put into practice the five steps that bridge the gap between imagination and reality&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Use real-life experiences of success to lay the groundwork for your own&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Put into practice the everyday habits that successful millionaires used to get where they are&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever been afraid that you were just not cut out to be successful, this is the time to conquer that fear. With every goal that you set and accomplish, you will see how the steps outlined in this book contribute to your achievement. The only thing standing between you and your dreams is your mindset. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing quite like real-life proof to convince a skeptic &amp;mdash; so give &lt;i&gt;Millionaire Mindset: Simple Habits &amp;amp; Ideas to Manifest An Abundance of Money, Wealth &amp;amp; Success&lt;/i&gt; space on your shelf, and see what you can manifest for your future!" />
