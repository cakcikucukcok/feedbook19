  <title>Trust - Kathy Bloomgarden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;TRUST: The Secret Weapon of Effective Business Leaders taps into a powerful current in American business - the importance of trust in a business&#39;s corporate strategy.  In today&#39;s environment, leaders who add the most value to their companies tend to make decisions based not on short-term financial goals, but on strongly-held values.  They develop a reservoir of trust among their key stakeholders and use it to speak frankly as challenges arise.  These leaders are inspired by an adherence to principles that form, for each of them, a platform of rock-solid values they will not violate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TRUST brings into vivid focus the characteristics that make today&#39;s leaders successful, and the principles and techniques they use to earn the confidence of employees, colleagues, customers and the public. Using dozens of interviews with top business leaders, as well as real-life  anecdotes and situations, CEO and business adviser Kathy Bloomgarden offers practical recommendations that can be applied by anyone, whether a corporate CEO, an executive of a not-for-profit organization, a politician, a division president, or even an ambitious young person at the beginning of his or her career.&lt;/p&gt;" />
