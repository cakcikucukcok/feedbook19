  <title>How Growth Really Happens - Michael H. Best</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A groundbreaking study that shows how countries can create innovative, production-based economies for the twenty-first century&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Achieving economic growth is one of today&#39;s key challenges. In this groundbreaking book, Michael Best argues that to understand how successful growth happens we need an economic framework that focuses on production, enterprise, and governance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This production-centric framework is the culmination of three simultaneous journeys. The first has been Best&#39;s visits to hundreds of factories worldwide, starting early as the son of a labor organizer and continuing through his work as an academic and industrial consultant. The second is a survey of two-hundred years of economic thought from Babbage to Krugman, with stops along the way for Marx, Marshall, Young, Penrose, Richardson, Schumpeter, Kuznets, Abramovitz, Keynes, and Jacobs. The third is a tour of historical episodes of successful and failed transformations, focusing sharply on three core elements--the production system, business organization, and skill formation&amp;#8212;and their interconnections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best makes the case that government should create the institutional infrastructures needed to support these elements and their interconnections rather than subsidize individual enterprises. The power of Best&#39;s alternative framework is illustrated by case studies of transformative experiences previously regarded as economic &quot;miracles&quot;: America&#39;s World War II industrial buildup, Germany&#39;s postwar recovery, Greater Boston&#39;s innovation system, Ireland&#39;s tech-sector boom, and the rise of the Asian Tigers and China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accessible and engaging, &lt;i&gt;How Growth Really Happens&lt;/i&gt; is required reading for anyone who wants to advance today&#39;s crucial debates about industrial policy, free trade, outsourcing, and the future of work.&lt;/p&gt;" />
