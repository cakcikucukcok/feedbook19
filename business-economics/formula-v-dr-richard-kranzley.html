  <title>Formula V - Dr. Richard Kranzley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In a model which combines wisdom and experience across ages and cultures, Formula V asks: How do we tap the ability that resides in each of us to lead with Vitality (exuberant mental vigor; capacity for a meaningful or purposeful existence)? How do we move from mimicry of others to transforming ourselves?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It starts with changing our definition of leadership. We need to shift our distinctions and assessments from skills and competencies to qualities and character. We could all benefit from switching our focus from doing leadership to BEING a leader. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Based on in-depth experience in coaching organizational leaders for 30 years across diverse industries, Kranzley guides the reader through a model based on five (or V) Qualities or Virtues: Courage, Humility, Honesty, Resonance, and Altruism. By honing ones leadership character to incorporate these into authentic behavior, a leader can grow into leadership with lasting significance. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Are these qualities learned or are they innate? Leadership is like poetry. You can improve language skills, build vocabulary, and learn about rhythm and rhyme. In that way one enables those inner poets to shine, ONLY IF there is a poet already inside. Formula V will help you assess your areas of need and of power.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In our world today, we are challenged by an increasingly uncertain and rapidly evolving global economy where leadership is affected by not only the values of national cultures, but also the belief systems and paradigms of the worlds varying religious traditions. It becomes paramount for a leader in todays world to understand how connecting with the core of ones being (spirit) will equate to leading with vitality.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rick shares cross-cultural stories and fables to illustrate and entertain (The Cow and the Pig, The Three Blind Men, Arachne, Student of Athena); taps the insight and wisdom of some of the worlds sages (Aristotle, Lao-Tzu, Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, Ted Collins, Nelson Mandela); and shares thought-provoking examples of leaders who will remind readers of who we want to be, and who we dont. Formula V will help unlock the leader who you want to be." />
