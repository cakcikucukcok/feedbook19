  <title>The Rise of the Naked Economy - Ryan Coonerty, Jeremy Neuner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What happens when work is no longer a place but a state of mind: when the trappings that have defined the economy as we knew it are stripped away and we start from the bare essence of what it means to make a living? From corner coffee shops to &lt;i&gt;Fortune&lt;/i&gt; 500 companies, workers from all different backgrounds are creating a new reality and prosperity. &lt;i&gt;The Rise of the Naked Economy&lt;/i&gt; shows readers how to achieve both personal and professional success in an economy that does not guarantee lifetime employment. Pioneers Coonerty and Neuner report from the front lines on the future of work. From the recently graduated to the recently laid off, this book covers how the rise in non-traditional employment calls for a new infrastructure, strategy, and attitude for workers, companies, and communities alike. Through interviews with the people, companies, and policymakers who are leading the change and already profiting from it, &lt;i&gt;The Rise of the Naked Economy&lt;/i&gt; provides an optimistic, humorous, and inspirational vision for readers who want reclaim their lives and livelihoods." />
