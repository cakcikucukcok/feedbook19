      <meta name="description" content="A quantum dot is a nanocrystal produced of semiconductor matters that are not so large sufficient to exhibit quantum automatic assets, especially its excitons are apprehended in altogether 3 space related proportions. The microelectronic assets of those matters are in-between amid these of mass Semiconductors and of separate molecules. Quantum spots remained ascertained in the first 1980s by Alexei Ekimov in a glass matrix and by Louis E. Brus in colloidal results.
