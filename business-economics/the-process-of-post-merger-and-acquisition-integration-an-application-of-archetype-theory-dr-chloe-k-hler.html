  <title>The Process of Post-Merger and Acquisition Integration: An Application of Archetype Theory - Dr. Chloe Köhler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The vast scale of mergers and acquisitions in recent years, in particular those of a European cross-border nature, is evidence of their increasing centrality to business strategy. However despite their popularity, several studies suggest that a high percentage of M&amp;A fail to realise anticipated value.  	 The process of post-M&amp;A integration is considered a key component of M&amp;A performance. Several theories have been advanced to assess M&amp;A success or failure, yet no theory has been able to explain the complexities of M&amp;A single-handedly.   The author applies archetype theory as a guide to the development of a new multidisciplinary framework suitable for the study of post-M&amp;A integration. With its complementary notions, archetype theory provides the basis upon which existing schools are brought together within a comprehensive framework. More importantly, it draws attention to significant aspects of integration which are missing from other theories and offers a new vocabulary with which to study these." />
