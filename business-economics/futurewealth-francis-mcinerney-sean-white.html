  <title>FutureWealth - Francis McInerney, Sean White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The American economy has been turned upside down during the past decade in one of the most tumultuous economic revolutions in world history. The result: the United States has put more distance between itself and its commercial rivals than anyone imagined possible. Annual growth in the U.S. economy matches the size of whole countries. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has reached once-unthinkable heights. Three-quarters of the world&#39;s top fifty companies are now American.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;FutureWealth&lt;/i&gt;, a superbly researched book, the authors provide a startling new way of looking at America&#39;s success. The reason for our exceptional performance is the breathtaking pace at which U.S. companies today substitute information for all other resources at their disposal. The authors explore major companies that have substituted information throughout their operations. They also show how the results have been dramatic in those companies&#39; expanded bottom lines and rising stock valuations-- and how investors can both learn and profit from the information revolution around us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;FutureWealth&lt;/i&gt; is a landmark book and a very timely read for investors, managers, and policy makers the world over.&lt;/p&gt;" />
