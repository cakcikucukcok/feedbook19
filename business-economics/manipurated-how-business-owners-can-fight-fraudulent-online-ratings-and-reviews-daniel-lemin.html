  <title>Manipurated: How Business Owners Can Fight Fraudulent Online Ratings and Reviews - Daniel Lemin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Manipurated&quot; is a manifesto for business owners struggling against an online ratings and reviews industry that is holding their businesses hostage through manipulative practices. &quot;Manipurated&quot; uniquely combines an exposé of the shifty inner workings of this industry with a step-by-step playbook to empower the 30 million American business owners desperately trying to fight back. In today&#39;s hyperconnected world, business owners are confronted with the challenge of managing their online reputation right out of the gate. The first weekend for a new deli, salon, café, or boutique store can be make-or-break with online reviews. Few business owners understand that amazing businesses can be permanently damaged with a few bad reviews. Managing a reputation online requires skills and tactics that are not always intuitive to business owners. &quot;Manipurated&quot; gives business owners an insider&#39;s view of how the multibillion-dollar ratings and reviews machine systematically stacks the cards against them - and more important, empowers business owners to fight back with a six-step playbook to defend, control, and enhance their business&#39;s online reputation. Both a warning and a call to action, &quot;Manipurated&quot; is a must-read for all small business owners who depend on online reviews." />
