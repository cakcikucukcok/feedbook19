  <title>Guide to Broker Price Opinion Success - Allison Robbins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In todays real estate market, only the innovative survive. As real estate agents, we need to utilize all sources of income available to us within our industry.  BPOs (Broker Price Opinions) are a great way to generate extra income or become a full time BPO agent and watch the cash stack up!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The key to becoming a successful money making machine in the bpo industry is within this book.  I will walk you through how to get business, how to maintain and grow business relationships with asset companies, and how to become a fully functional bpo producer that can yield more than 10,000 in monthly revenue. Consider thisMost agents would have to sell 2-4 houses a month to generate the income that I make in BPOs in one month. Here is the kicker, I dont even work 8 hours a day, and I have every weekend to spend with my family.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;BPOs are guaranteed money, with very little expenditures and checks paid to you on a monthly basis. They easily become something to depend on in todays market. Even while doing traditional real estate sales, BPOs can become that extra income you have been looking for and will also help you stay abreast on local market activity in the process.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Are you new to real estate? Are you tired of getting leads that never pan out? Tired of driving clients around to 20 houses before they decide not to buy? Have you put your license on inactive status until the market changes? In real estate, only the strong survive. If you have been doing the same thing and yielding poor results, maybe its time to try something new. Are you ready to start making the income you deserve?&lt;/p&gt;" />
