  <title>Modern Social Media Marketing - Dwayne Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Are you ready to start doing effective social media marketing today?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A lot of marketers have all sorts of wrong ideas about social media marketing.&lt;br /&gt;
Some think that you only need to post &amp;quot;viral content&amp;quot; to get tons of traffic overnight. Yes , You can&amp;nbsp; ! , If You do it Right&lt;br /&gt;
They actually believe that if you are able to pump that much traffic to your target website, a large chunk of those people would buy whatever it is you are selling.&lt;br /&gt;
There is an assumption that social traffic, regardless of which platform it comes from and regardless of how you qualify that traffic, converts to sales readily.&lt;br /&gt;
Sadly, none of these assumptions are true. In fact, all of them are tragically mistaken&lt;br /&gt;
Well, unfortunately, Google went through several algorithm changes over the years. You probably have heard of Google Panda, Google Penguin and Rankbrain because back in those&amp;nbsp; day, you can build something and people will come to your page as if by magic. That&amp;#39;s how Google&amp;#39;s algorithm was set up. In fact, prior to the year 2010, Google would actively look for new blog posts using RSS feed technology to find the &amp;quot;latest and greatest&amp;quot; content where&amp;nbsp; you can just publish a blog post, ping your post, and you are assured to get quite a number of eyeballs.&lt;br /&gt;
Well ,for&amp;nbsp; now the&amp;nbsp; old rules don&amp;#39;t work anymore. Sadly, a lot of people missed the memo on this. There are still a tremendous amount of books and seminars out there who convince people that we are living in circa 1999-2000.Let me tell you, building a website doesn&amp;#39;t mean anybody will show up to check it out. The same applies to social media.&lt;br /&gt;
There&amp;#39;s a lot of hype regarding Facebook and Twitter marketing, but here&amp;#39;s the truth. Just because you post content on those platforms, it doesn&amp;#39;t automatically mean people would be interested in what you have to share. &amp;quot;Build it and they will come&amp;quot; is as equally bankrupt nowadays on social media as it is with content publishing on blogs.&lt;br /&gt;
If any of this applies to you, I&amp;#39;ve got some great news for you. While the whole &amp;quot;build it and they will come&amp;quot; approach does not work because of traffic technology changes, consumer content habit changes, and evolving monetization rules, there is still a way to generate the same results through social media. In fact, the answer is actually quite obvious. It&amp;#39;s probably staring at you right now.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Modern Social Media Marketing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When you publish content and share it on social media, let me step you through the process of turning that content into cold, hard cash.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; You are going to understand that whatever the case may be, the endgame is to get people to join your list.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; You will know how to call to action to the people through social media so they join your list.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; You will learn which platforms you should focus on in order to be successful.&lt;br /&gt;
