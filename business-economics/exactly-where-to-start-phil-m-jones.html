  <title>Exactly Where to Start - Phil M. Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Get out of your own way and bring your ideas to life!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Exactly Where to Start&lt;/i&gt; is a playbook for everyone with a great idea, everyone with a goal in mind, and everyone with a specific destination but no journey. We’ve been told all our lives that “good things come to those who wait”—but that’s a myth. Good things come to those who &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt;. Too often, we get stuck in the “getting ready” stage: research, analysis, brainstorming, and more research; we feel like we need to know everything there is to know about what we want to do before we ever take the first steps. Meanwhile, the people who actually go out and &lt;i&gt;do the thing&lt;/i&gt; are taking risks, learning lessons, and making strides toward their goals every single day. Isn’t it time you joined them?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This book coaches you through the journey with precise, actionable steps that help you take that all-important first leap and keep the momentum going. Discard the distractions, break through the overwhelm, and get going for real with this real-world blueprint for turning your vision into reality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Snap yourself out of “analysis paralysis”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Stop thinking you need to know &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt; before you even begin&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Make those big decisions and focus in on your goals&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Chart your journey’s path, and get up and get started today&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many of us have fallen into a trap: we no longer believe that “anything is possible”, yet we are surrounded by proof that &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt; is possible! But we are distracted, harried, overwhelmed, and maybe a little intimidated. Our dreams remain forever in limbo, and we may go to our graves before we venture beyond the “planning stage”. Don’t let that happen—don’t you deserve to realize your goals? &lt;i&gt;Exactly Where to Start&lt;/i&gt; gives you the kick in the pants and the practical plan you need to stand up, step up, and make it happen. &lt;/p&gt;" />
