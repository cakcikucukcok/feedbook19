  <title>Summary: Getting Into Your Customer&#39;s Head - Kevin Davis - BusinessNews Publishing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book “GETTING INTO YOUR CUSTOMER’S HEAD: 8 Secret Roles of Selling Your Competitors Don’t Know” by Kevin Davis. In Getting Into Your Customer’s Head, Kevin Davis explains that most sales today are made through a four-stage buy-learning process: 1. Prospective customers become aware of a need for something  2. They study all the options available to meet that need, and the cost of each option  3. They make a buying decision  and 4. They evaluate whether or not they are receiving value-for-money on an ongoing basis. To be most effective, the sales process requires the sales person to adopt different roles at different times, depending on which stage of the buy-learning process the person is at. The various sales roles provide suggested modes of action that will be appropriate for each of those given situations. Customer-focused selling requires sellers to go through an entire sequence of customer-focused selling roles: student, doctor, architect, coach, therapist, negotiator, teacher and farmer. Each of these distinctive roles are designed to match productive sales techniques with the buyer’s behavior and requirements throughout the overall sales sequence. Getting Into Your Customer’s Head is a useful and practical guide for salespeople willing to succeed in today’s marketplace." />
