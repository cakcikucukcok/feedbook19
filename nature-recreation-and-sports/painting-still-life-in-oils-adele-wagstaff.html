  <title>Painting Still Life in Oils - Adele Wagstaff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Still life painting is an exciting genre, which allows the artist to explore colour, shape and form using as many or as few objects as they like. A still life can be quiet, tranquil and contemplative in mood, or be a celebration of pure colour and expression. This book introduces the genre using the medium of oil paint as a step-by-step process, from painting simple compositions of one object to complex arrangements of more unusual subject matter. Each chapter focuses on a different aspect of preparing for a painting: from studying a still life using a variety of drawing techniques to basic colour theory; from painting with a limited tonal range to using the full impressionist palette. The compositions studied include traditional still life subjects and more unusual objects, and advice is given on materials, including how to stretch your own canvas. The work of notable still life painters is used as inspiration for your work, and the book introduces painting still life within the genre of portraiture. Aimed at beginners and the more experienced; untutored groups and individual artists and beautifully illustrated with 190 colour illustrations." />
