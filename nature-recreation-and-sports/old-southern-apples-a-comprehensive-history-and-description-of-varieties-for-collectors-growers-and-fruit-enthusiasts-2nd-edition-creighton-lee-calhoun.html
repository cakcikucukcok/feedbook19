  <title>Old Southern Apples: A Comprehensive History and Description of Varieties for Collectors, Growers, and Fruit Enthusiasts, 2nd Edition - Creighton Lee Calhoun</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A book that became an instant classic when it first appeared in 1995, &lt;em&gt;Old Southern Apples&lt;/em&gt; is an indispensable reference for fruit lovers everywhere, especially those who live in the southern United States. Out of print for several years, this newly revised and expanded edition now features descriptions of some 1,800 apple varieties that either originated in the South or were widely grown there before 1928.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Author Lee Calhoun is one of the foremost figures in apple conservation in America. This masterwork reflects his knowledge and personal experience over more than thirty years, as he sought out and grew hundreds of classic apples, including both legendary varieties (like Nickajack and Magnum Bonum) and little-known ones (like Buff and Cullasaga). Representing our common orchard heritage, many of these apples are today at risk of disappearing from our national table.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Illustrated with more than 120 color images of classic apples from the National Agricultural Library&#39;s collection of watercolor paintings, &lt;em&gt;Old Southern Apples&lt;/em&gt; is a fascinating and beautiful reference and gift book. In addition to A-to-Z descriptions of apple varieties, both extant and extinct, Calhoun provides a brief history of apple culture in the South, and includes practical information on growing apples and on their traditional uses.&lt;/p&gt;" />
