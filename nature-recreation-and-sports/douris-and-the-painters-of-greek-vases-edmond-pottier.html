  <title>Douris and the Painters of Greek Vases - Edmond Pottier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Uniform Title: Douris et les peintres des vases grecs. English&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Douris is a painter on Greek vases with red figures , active from 500 to 460 BC. AD&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is characterized by a loaded ornamentation and by the diversity of border patterns. The favorite subjects are banquets, komoi (processions of drunk people) or warriors. The favorite kalos name is Kh&amp;aelig;restratos. Beazley suggests that at that time, Douris could have worked side by side with On&amp;eacute;simos, another great painter of cups of the period. Compared to the latter, Douris favors the grace of his characters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is the most characteristic phase of Douris, and its peak. The medallion borders are characterized by the alternation of a meander element and tiles; palmettes decorate the handles of the cup. The preferred kalos name is now Hippodamas; signatures are becoming scarce. Douris returns to banquet scenes, and is also interested in warrior studies and school scenes. The masterpiece of the period is the cup known as the &amp;quot;piet&amp;agrave; of Memnon&amp;quot;: Eos takes away the body of his son Memnon , killed by Achilles during the Trojan War.&lt;br /&gt;
