  <title>Coach Manju Nitta&#39;s Baseball Secrets - Michael M. Okihiro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is an informational book on the basic mechanics of baseball, how to throw, field and hit a baseball.  The same basic mechanics apply to softball.  They are easy to learn and by learning them, the game should become more enjoyable and exciting.  The information is aimed primarily at youngsters who are learning the game, but should find application to ballplayers at every stage of development.  
As every serious student of baseball knows, there are dozens of instructional books on the game.  So why another one?  Well, there are a number of us who feel that George Manju Nittas knowledge of the intricacies of the game goes far beyond the obvious and ordinary, and that many of the things that he has learned and has been willing to teach, his secrets, are not found in the many books that are available today.  Furthermore, he says hes learned so much from the kids as well as the parents who bring them to him and some of these insights will be included in this book." />
