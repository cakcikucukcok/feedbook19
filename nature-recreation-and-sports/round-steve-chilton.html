  <title>Round - Steve Chilton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Round is not only a history of the Bob Graham Round, but also an exploration of the what, why and how of this classic fell endurance challenge. After covering the genesis of the BGR in detail, it documents its development from a more-or-less idle challenge to its present status as a rite of passage for endurance runners. Interspersed with this detail of the round are extensive profiles of many of the event’s most significant individuals: innovators, record setters, recorders and supporters. Some links to resources for potential BGR completers are be included. The Round is emphatically NOT a ‘how to’ guide, but it IS a terrific follow up to Steve Chilton’s hugely popular first book, It’s a Hill, Get Over It." />
