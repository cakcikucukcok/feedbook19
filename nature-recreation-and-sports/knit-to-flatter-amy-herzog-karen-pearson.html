  <title>Knit to Flatter - Amy Herzog, Karen Pearson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;nit to Flatter&lt;/i&gt; is about celebrating the body you have been given and creating sweaters that make you look and feel great. Part instruction manual and part pattern collection, &lt;i&gt;Knit to Flatter&lt;/i&gt; teaches you how to assess your shape--top-heavy, bottom-heavy, or proportional-- and then knit accordingly. With a great sense of fun and acceptance, Amy Herzog presents silhouettes and styles that work with each body shape, along with four ideal sweater patterns per category. She then provides patterns for 10 more sweaters with guidelines for customizing, so they can be tailored to flatter. Each pattern is written in up to 10 sizes, and the garments are photographed on models with genuine curves. No smoke and mirrors here. Just real beauty!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Praise for&lt;i&gt; Knit to Flatter&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;&lt;i&gt;Knit to Flatter&lt;/i&gt; is $24.95 in the US, which works out to a little more than $1 per style, but you shouldn&#39;t expect to make all the styles in this book. What you will get is great lessons on what looks best on you and why--terrific information you can use to your own best advantage. Some people might say that sort of information is priceless.+? --My Central Jersey&#39;s &lt;i&gt;In Stitches &lt;/i&gt;blog&lt;br&gt;

&quot;A knitter&#39;s manifesto!+? -- &quot;Stash and Burn+? podcast&lt;br&gt;
Â &lt;br&gt;
&quot;Every knitter that knits sweaters should own this book.Â The feeling of this book is 100% body positive. Go buy it already!+? --Knitty.com&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;I feel like this book is one that is so needed right now. There are so many luscious knitwear patterns being designed and released these days, it&#39;s easy to rush into knitting everything that is popular. I know I&#39;ve been guilty of that, and then disappointed in the end when the finished garment made me embarrassed to wear it in public. Getting more guidance on what styles would be more suitable seems like the smartest thing to do before investing a good chunk of change in a sweater&#39;s worth of yarn.+?Â --&lt;i&gt;Sweet Georgia Yarns&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Â &lt;br&gt;
&quot;There is no doubt in mind that you are bound to fall in love with more than a few of these sweaters and the techniques that bring them into being.+? --&lt;i&gt;The A.D.D Knitter&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&quot;What this book really is, is the girlfriend you take when you go shopping. The one who&#39;s not afraid to say, &#39;Hmmm maybe not thoseÂ jeans, try these instead.&#39; We&#39;ve got Amy. She&#39;s going to help us all get over those numbers on the tape measure, on the scale, on the tag in our clothes and focus on what works.+? --&lt;i&gt;Savory Knitting&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Â &lt;br&gt;
&quot;Such self-assuredness is a gift we all were born with and deserve to feel on a daily basis.Â You wouldn&#39;t think we needed a book like this, but we do. We&#39;re lucky it&#39;s here.+? --&lt;i&gt;Knitter&#39;s Review&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&quot;I&#39;m a little obsessed with knitters making sweaters that fit and look good on them. I was so excited when I got Amy Herzog&#39;s new book.+? --Knitty.com&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Gosh darn cute. the pink polka dot binding, the layout and graphic design of the book, the models . . .

&quot;You pick a pattern and buy some yarn. One hundred and fifty dollars and forty hours later, you try on your freshly knitted sweater and . . . oh no. You vow to take up scrapbooking.
