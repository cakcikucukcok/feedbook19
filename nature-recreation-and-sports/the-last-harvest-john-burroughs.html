  <title>The Last Harvest - John Burroughs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is John Burroughs&#39; 1922 biography of Ralph Waldo Emerson, &quot;The Last Harvest&quot;. It is a masterful piece of writing that provides a unique and profound insight into the life of American poet Last Harvest. This volume is highly recommended for those with an interest in the work and mind of Emerson, and it is not to be missed by fans of Burroughs&#39; fantastic work. Contents include: &quot;Emerson And His Journals&quot;, &quot;Flies In Amber&quot;, &quot;Another Word On Thoreau&quot;, &quot;A Critical Glance Into Darwin&quot;, &quot;What Makes A Poem?&quot;, &quot;Short Studies In Contrasts&quot;, &quot;Day By Day&quot;, &quot;Gleanings&quot;, &quot;Sundown Papers&quot;, and more. John Burroughs (1837 - 1921) was an American naturalist, essayist, and active member of the U.S. conservation movement. Burroughs&#39; work was incredibly popular during his lifetime, and his legacy has lived on in the form of twelve U.S. Schools named after him, Burroughs Mountain, and the John Burroughs Association-which publicly recognizes well-written and illustrated natural history publications. Many vintage books such as this are becoming increasingly scarce and expensive. We are republishing this volume now in an affordable, modern, high-quality edition complete with a specially commissioned new biography of the author." />
