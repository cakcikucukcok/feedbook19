  <title>Alaskan Adventures—Hunting and Fishing by Faith - Bert Schultz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Bert Schultz authors his second book of Alaskan adventures, this time about fifty years of hunting and fishing experiences. Arriving in Alaska at age twenty-five, he quickly found it necessary to provide food for his family from the wilds of Alaska. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine fishing the Kenai Peninsulas Russian River in the late 1950s and never seeing another fisherman. Or on the first day of moose season seeing five legal moose within a quarter mile of your Caribou Hills campsite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having little experience fishing or hunting, he in faith believed God would provide. And he saw God work the impossible and had many exciting adventures along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These true stories will keep you reading until you finish ALASKAN ADVENTURESHUNTING AND FISHING BY FAITH.&lt;/p&gt;" />
