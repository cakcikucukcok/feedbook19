  <title>The King of Sports - Gregg Easterbrook</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Gregg Easterbrook, author of the wildly popular ESPN.com column &lt;i&gt;Tuesday Morning Quarterback&lt;/i&gt; takes on football&#39;s place in American society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gridiron football is the king of sports - it&#39;s the biggest game in the strongest and richest country in the world. Of the twenty most-watched television broadcasts ever, both in the United States and internationally, all twenty were Super Bowls. In &lt;i&gt;The King of Sports,&lt;/i&gt; Easterbrook tells the full story of how football became so deeply ingrained in American culture. Both good and bad, he examines its impact on American society at all levels of the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The King of Sports&lt;/i&gt; explores these and many other topics:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; *  The real harm done by concussions (it&#39;s not to NFL players).&lt;br&gt; *  The real way in which college football players are exploited (it&#39;s not by not being paid).&lt;br&gt; *  The way football helps American colleges (it&#39;s not bowl revenue) and American cities (it&#39;s not Super Bowl wins).&lt;br&gt; *  What happens to players who are used up and thrown away (it&#39;s not pretty).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; *  The hidden scandal of the NFL (it&#39;s worse than you think).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using his year-long exclusive insider access to the Virginia Tech football program, where Frank Beamer has compiled the most victories of any active NFL or major-college head coach while also graduating players, Easterbrook shows how one big university &quot;does football right.&quot; Then he reports on what&#39;s wrong with football at the youth, high school, college and professional levels. Easterbrook holds up examples of coaches and programs who put the athletes first and still win; he presents solutions to these issues and many more, showing a clear path forward for the sport as a whole. Rich with reporting details from interviews with current and former college and pro football players and coaches, &lt;i&gt;The King of Sports&lt;/i&gt; promises to be the most provocative and best-read sports book of the year.&lt;/p&gt;" />
