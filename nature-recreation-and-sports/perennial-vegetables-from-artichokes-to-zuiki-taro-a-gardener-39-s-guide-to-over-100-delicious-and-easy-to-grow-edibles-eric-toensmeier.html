  <title>Perennial Vegetables: From Artichokes to Zuiki Taro, A Gardener&#39;s Guide to Over 100 Delicious and Easy to Grow Edibles - Eric Toensmeier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There is a fantastic array of vegetables you can grow in your garden, and not all of them are annuals. In &lt;em&gt;Perennial Vegetables&lt;/em&gt; the adventurous gardener will find information, tips, and sound advice on less common edibles that will make any garden a perpetual, low-maintenance source of food.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Imagine growing vegetables that require just about the same amount of care as the flowers in your perennial beds and borders-no annual tilling and potting and planting. They thrive and produce abundant and nutritious crops throughout the season. It sounds too good to be true, but in &lt;em&gt;Perennial Vegetables&lt;/em&gt; author and plant specialist Eric Toensmeier (&lt;em&gt;Edible Forest Gardens&lt;/em&gt;) introduces gardeners to a world of little-known and wholly underappreciated plants. Ranging beyond the usual suspects (asparagus, rhubarb, and artichoke) to include such &quot;minor&quot; crops as ground cherry and ramps (both of which have found their way onto exclusive restaurant menus) and the much sought after, anti-oxidant-rich wolfberry (also known as goji berries), Toensmeier explains how to raise, tend, harvest, and cook with plants that yield great crops and satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Perennial vegetables are perfect as part of an edible landscape plan or permaculture garden. Profiling more than 100 species, illustrated with dozens of color photographs and illustrations, and filled with valuable growing tips, recipes, and resources, &lt;em&gt;Perennial Vegetables&lt;/em&gt; is a groundbreaking and ground-healing book that will open the eyes of gardeners everywhere to the exciting world of edible perennials.&lt;/p&gt;" />
