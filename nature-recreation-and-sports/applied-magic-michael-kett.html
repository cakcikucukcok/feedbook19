  <title>Applied Magic - Michael Kett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;The author, Michael Kett, has been a physical therapist, as well as a magician, for more than 20 years. His therapy background includes working with neurologic, pediatric, orthopaedic and sports medicine patients. As a magician, he performs regularly at community festivals, restaurants, and private events. Michael&#39;s book, Applied Magic, is a blending of his passion for magic and his physical therapy experience.&lt;P&gt;Applied Magic is more than a beginner&#39;s magic book. Each of the 52 magic effects and activities was specifically chosen for its therapeutic potential. Specific therapeutic considerations and difficulty level are suggested for each effect. The 93 illustrations make learning easy. Also included are chapters that discuss basic magic principles, how to teach magic, and using magic to tell a story. This book is an outstanding resource for any therapist, teacher or parent looking for innovative methods to improve gross and fine motor control, self-confidence, and social interaction skills.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&quot;Applied Magic is a creative addition to any therapist&#39;s repertoire.&lt;P&gt;- Peggy Stell, pediatric physical therapist&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt; I think the idea of using magic in a classroom setting to develop social and presentation skills is fantastic.  &lt;P&gt;- Colleen Lundell, special education teacher&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&quot;Applied Magic is a great resource for therapists looking for new and interesting ways to make therapy fun.&quot; &lt;P&gt;- Melinda Buehring, physical therapist/certified Feldenkrais practitioner&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The magic effects are explained step by step with great illustrations. I recommend Applied Magic to anyone inquiring about a beginners magic book.&lt;P&gt;- Tim Hannig, childrens entertainer/magician&lt;/P&gt;" />
