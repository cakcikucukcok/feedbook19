  <title>Learning from Dogs: Innate Wisdom from Man&#39;s Best Friend - Paul Handover</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a tiny amount of domesticated wolf in all of us. The relationship between canids and humans goes back nearly 40,000 years, when dogs split away from wolves. With our dogs, we have traveled the ancient track from hunter-gatherers to modern humans. However, this track now seems to offer an uncertain future for humankind and society.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Learning from Dogs&amp;nbsp;shows how and why now, more than ever, we humans need to learn from our dogs. At times the book relates personal stories through autobiography, diary, and blog entries. Other times it reinforces a point with speculative and imaginative fictional narrative. Throughout the book, there is a foundation about the history of wolves, dogs, and humans, as the author injects factual research to assist us to more fully understand the importance of this unique relationship.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With just the right blend of humor, story-telling, perception, compassion, and insight, the author shares his unusual perspective and how he came to share what he&amp;rsquo;s learned through a lifetime of observation and interaction with dogs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Readers who love dogs, or any animals, will connect with this book and become more fully aware of why our animal friends are valuable to learn from to help us heal the challenges of the 21st century. Occasionally launching into intellectual tangents that will provide intrigue and inspiration for the heart and soul, the book ultimately returns to the central thesis: &amp;ldquo;What we can (and should) learn from dogs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Pat Shipman,&amp;nbsp;retired adjunct professor of anthropology at The Pennsylvania State University, and the author of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Animal Connection&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The invaders; How Humans and Their Dogs Drove Neanderthals to Extinction,&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;described the book as, &amp;quot;both wise and thoughtful. It also includes some of the best writing about the intimate and special relationship between dogs and humans I have ever read.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
