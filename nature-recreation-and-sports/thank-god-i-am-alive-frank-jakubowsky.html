  <title>Thank God, I Am Alive - Frank Jakubowsky</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Many people are aware of the eighty-nine earthquake because it happened just before the World Series baseball game between the Oakland As and the San Francisco Giants. It was on television as the game was about to start. This book presents a new idea about healing with regard to any earthquake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It explains why this earthquake happened and so gives general principles that may cause an earthquake. Author Frank Jakubowsky gives a new idea about this earthquake that can help explain the many effects that cause an earthquake. Probably the most important idea is that there are principles that help in predicting the time of aftershocks. Aftershocks are common after a big earthquake, and to predict the timing of them would be important. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank God, I Am Alive were the words of Buck Helm after he was rescued from being trapped for eighty-nine hours. Jakubowsky uses those words as a theme for rebuilding and looking for positive ideas about earthquakes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeking to inspire by offering tales of how God helped in lessening the effect of the earthquake, this collection includes many personal stories.&lt;/p&gt;" />
