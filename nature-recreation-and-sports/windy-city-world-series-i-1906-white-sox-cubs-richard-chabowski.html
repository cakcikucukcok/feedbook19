  <title>Windy City World Series I: 1906, White Sox–Cubs - Richard Chabowski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The year 1906 holds special significance for the city of Chicago for a number of reasons, but probably nothing generated as much excitement as the all-Chicago World Series that pitted the White Sox against the Cubs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upton Sinclair had just written The Jungle, which revealed the inner workings of the citys slaughterhouses. There was also a new central city and county government building rising in the Loop. In considerations of that year, however, it is the citys two baseball teams that probably generate the most attention. More than one hundred years have passed, and we still havent seen a repeat of the all-Chicago World Series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This history examines the bold moves made by ballclub owners and managers, and puts the significance of baseball in context with this detailed account of the events of 1906. It also introduces Charles Comiskey before the Black Sox scandal as well as Charles Murphy, the feisty, lively owner of the Cubs. The entire season is relived in Windy City World Series I: 1906, White SoxCubs.&lt;/p&gt;" />
