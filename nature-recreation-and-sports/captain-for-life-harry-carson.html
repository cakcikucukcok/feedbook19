  <title>Captain for Life - Harry Carson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;A unique and powerful personal tale about the great joy and devastating price of playing professional football, by a legendary former NFL linebacker&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest linebackers to ever play professional football, Harry Carson built a reputation during his 13 years in the NFL as a fearsome, physical and passionate player who would give everything he had to win. Whether violently tackling running backs, engaging blockers with reckless abandon or ferociously attacking the line of scrimmage, Carson will always be remembered as having played the game the way it&#39;s meant to be played--all out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time ever, this legendary athlete takes readers on an unlikely journey to the NFL that began in the small town of Florence, South Carolina to his days at little known South Carolina State University--and then the bright lights of professional football in New York, playing for the Giants. Carson&#39;s story of his life as a football player and after his retirement is more powerful and eye-opening than any that&#39;s come before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within these pages, Carson reveals the startling truth behind the sacrifices these great warriors make for our entertainment, the thrill of stepping onto a field with 80,000 fans screaming your name, and the debilitating physical and mental toll this violent and uncompromising game takes. With insight into some of the game&#39;s biggest stars, from Lawrence Taylor to Bill Parcells to Phil Simms this book is a must for any NFL fan.&lt;/p&gt;" />
