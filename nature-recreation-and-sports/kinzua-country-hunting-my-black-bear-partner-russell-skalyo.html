  <title>Kinzua Country Hunting - My Black Bear Partner - Russell Skalyo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book presents over forty years of hunting experiences at a remote rustic cabin located in a rugged area of Pennsylvania called Kinzua Country.   This cabin is located along a dirt road many miles from the main highway deep inside the Allegheny National Forest in McKean County near the Kinzua Dam.     The first section of this book recounts how a black bear interrupted the hunt of a large six point buck.  The second section is about two young outdoors-men using their skills honed from the Pennsylvania woods to venture deep into a much different type of wilderness for a moose hunt in a mountain region of Alaska.   The third section focuses on the camp activities of the remote hunting camp in the Kinzua forest.  The remaining sections involve hunting turkey, deer, bear and snow shoe rabbit.   Anyone who has ever enjoyed roaming in the Pennsylvania forest absorbing all of its natural wonder will be captivated by reading this book.   This book is my memoir of Kinzua Country hunting adventures." />
