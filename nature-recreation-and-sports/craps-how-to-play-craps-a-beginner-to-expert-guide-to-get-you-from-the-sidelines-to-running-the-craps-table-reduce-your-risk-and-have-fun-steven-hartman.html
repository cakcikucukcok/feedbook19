  <title>Craps: How to Play Craps: A Beginner to Expert Guide to Get You From The Sidelines to Running the Craps Table, Reduce Your Risk, and Have Fun - Steven Hartman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="You&amp;rsquo;ve heard the sudden bursts of cheers as you&amp;rsquo;ve strolled past the crowded Craps table.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You have even seen the countless TV shows and movies with the dice flying in slow motion over the green felt before knocking against the wall. The dealer barks out, &amp;ldquo;Winner!&amp;rdquo; and then the table roars with applause.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now you want in.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But as you step up to an empty, unused craps table in a Vegas casino just to survey the complex boxes with terms like &amp;ldquo;Field&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Pass Line&amp;rdquo;, you&amp;rsquo;re hesitant. You have second thoughts about going to an active table and putting $20 down because it just seems so impossible to play.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And then there isn&amp;rsquo;t just one dealer like at the blackjack table or roulette wheel, but four!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A bead of sweat tickles your brow and you walk away from the intimidating Craps table and decide to invest your money at the Wheel of Fortune slot machine or tackle a few hands at the three-card poker table.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Go Back!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book is designed for the beginner who has always wanted to experience the thrill of throwing the dice but was too afraid to learn how to play.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Worry not, shooter, this guide will have everything you need to step up to the table with confidence and have fun playing the wild game of Craps!&lt;br /&gt;
