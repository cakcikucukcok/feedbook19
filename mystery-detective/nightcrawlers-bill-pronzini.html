  <title>Nightcrawlers - Bill Pronzini</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Bill Pronzini&#39;s &quot;Nameless&quot; detective has become one of the longest-lived, and consistently highly praised, private investigators in the annals of American crime fiction and the award-winning author proves, once again, that his skills &lt;br&gt;are unmatched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things were quiet in the San Francisco-based agency Nameless founded and his&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;partners, Jake and Vanessa were itching to get back to work. A deadbeat father needed to be found, and Vanessa needed to do some field work, so she took the file and headed out to keep an eye on the last known address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jake got to work on something much more personal...and dangerous. The Castro had become the stomping ground, literally, of two violent gay-bashers and the most recent victim was Jake&#39;s son&#39;s lover. Father and son are estranged, but maybe helping now would help them reconcile. That was Jake&#39;s thought when he started. For Nameless it was all a matter of letting everyone know that if they needed his help, he was there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jake was handling his situation but for Vanessa, things got out of hand. Her perp never showed up, but when she saw a man carrying a young girl into the house across the street, she knew something was wrong....and about to get worse, because she was going to investigate what was going on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she doesn&#39;t show up a few days later, Nameless feels a sinking in his gut: a few years ago he&#39;d been kidnapped, shackled, and left to die in a cabin in the woods and something about Vanessa&#39;s disappearance echoed too loudly. When he discovers the house she&#39;d investigated on her own and sees the words TAKING US TO A HOUSE IN THE WOODS scrawled on a closet wall, the echo became thunderous. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now it was a race against time, and the clock had begun ticking before &quot;Nameless&quot; and Jake heard the starter&#39;s gun. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
