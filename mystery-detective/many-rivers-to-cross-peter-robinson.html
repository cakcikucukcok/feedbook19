  <title>Many Rivers to Cross - Peter Robinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peter Robinson, the acclaimed author of the bestselling series Stephen King calls &amp;#8220;the best now on the market,&amp;#8221; returns with a gripping, emotionally charged mystery in which the revered detective Alan Banks must find the truth about a murder with possible racial overtones&amp;#8212;and save a friend from ruin.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Eastvale, a young Middle Eastern boy is found dead, his body stuffed into a wheelie bin on the East Side Estate. Detective Superintendent Alan Banks and his team know they must tread carefully to solve this sensitive case, but tensions rise when they learn that the victim was stabbed somewhere else and dumped. Who is the boy, and where did he come from?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, in a decayed area of Eastvale scheduled for redevelopment, a heroin addict is found dead.&amp;#160;Was this just another tragic overdose, or something darker?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent tensions from reaching a boiling point, Banks must find answers quickly. Yet just when he needs to be at his sharpest, the seasoned detective finds himself distracted by a close friend&amp;#8217;s increasingly precarious situation. Banks needs a break&amp;#8212;and gets one when he finds a connection to a real estate developer who could be the key to finding the truth.&lt;/p&gt;        &lt;p&gt;With so many loose ends dangling, there is one thing Banks is sure of&amp;#8212;solving the case will come at a terrible cost.&lt;/p&gt;" />
