  <title>Political Philosophy and Political Action - Adam Burgos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Political philosophers have long taken inspiration from political movements when crafting their theories, which they hoped would address the universal problems of democracy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Political Philosophy and Political Action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;investigates the relationship between political practices of popular resistance and political theory. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The text demonstrates how the lived experience on political resistance can help us to analyse and interpret theory, and also reveals how concrete resistance movements can challenge the ideals of political theory generally. It begins by examining the universal aspirations present within the contextual particularities of Black Lives Matter, Occupy Wall Street, and the Arab Spring. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Political Philosophy and Political Action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;then turns to critical examination of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Karl Marx, John Dewey, and Jacques Ranci&amp;egrave;re, using novel interpretations of their philosophies of equality and democracy to construct a conceptual framework. More specifically, the chapters show how we can analyze resistance movements that incorporate the imperative to resist inequality in the name of democracy. The result is a novel means of thinking about important issues in contemporary political philosophy, including pluralism, oppression and domination, and the purposes and meaning of politics. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
