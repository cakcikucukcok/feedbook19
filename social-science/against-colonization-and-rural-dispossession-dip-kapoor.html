  <title>Against Colonization and Rural Dispossession - Dip Kapoor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Under
the guise of &#39;development&#39;, a globalizing capitalism has continued to cause
poverty through dispossession and the exploitation of labour across the Global
South. This process has been met with varied forms of rural resistance by local
movements of displaced farm workers, small and landless (women) peasants, and
indigenous peoples in South and East Asia, the Pacific and Africa, who are
resisting the forced appropriation of their land, the exploitation of labour
and the destruction of their ecosystems and ways of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this provocative
new collection, engaged scholars and activists combine grounded case studies
with both Marxist and anti-colonial analyses, suggesting that the developmental
project is a continuation of the colonial project. The authors then demonstrate
the ways in which these local struggles have attempted to resist colonization
and dispossession in the rural belt, thereby contributing essential movement-relevant
knowledge on
these experiences in the Global South.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A vital addition to the
fields of critical
development studies, political-sociology, agrarian studies and the anthropology
of resistance, this book addresses academics and
analysts who have either minimized or overlooked local resistances to colonial
capital, especially in the Asia-Pacific and Africa regions.&lt;/p&gt;" />
