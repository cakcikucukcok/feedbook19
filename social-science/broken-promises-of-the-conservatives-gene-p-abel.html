  <title>Broken Promises of the Conservatives - Gene P. Abel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Broken Promises of the Conservatives is intended help the reader understand the conservative ideology and look at how their promises have been kept. Our country is faced with a series of very serious issues that require solutions. Our huge budget deficit, tax reform, immigration, background checks to purchase guns, funding shortfall of Social Security and Medicare, rebuilding of our infrastructure, educating our children and the creation of living wage jobs to mention a few. This book will help the reader look at the conservative approach to these issues and document how they have dealt with each of them. The sources that have been used are primarily official United States Government Agencies such as the Department of the Treasury Bureau Public Debt, the CBO, OMB, the Department of Labor and various historical records of the United States Government. In addition studies from Harvard and Brown Universities and The Brookings Institute have been cited. 
The author, Gene P. Abel brings a successful and diverse educational and professional background to his factual analysis of the conservative policies. Mr. Abel has a formal education that includes a bachelors of science degree and a masters degree in business administration. He has 30 years as a highly successful business executive in both the private and public sectors overlaid with his 30 years service as a commissioned officer in the United States Army and Army Reserve. Mr. Abel graduated as a Distinguished Military Graduate from Penn State and spent 5 years on active duty as a Regular Army Officer and 25 years as an Army Reserve Officer. He completed the Army War College in 1985 and was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal on two occasions. He had such diverse assignments as nuclear weapons officer to finance officer. He retired as a Colonel in 1993." />
