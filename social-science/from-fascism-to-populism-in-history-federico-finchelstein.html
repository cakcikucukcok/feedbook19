  <title>From Fascism to Populism in History - Federico Finchelstein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What is fascism and what is populism? What are their connections in history and theory, and how should we address their significant differences? What does it mean when pundits call Donald Trump a fascist, or label as populist politicians who span left and right such as Hugo Ch&amp;aacute;vez, Juan Per&amp;oacute;n, Rodrigo Duterte, and Marine Le Pen? Federico Finchelstein, one of the leading scholars of fascist and populist ideologies, synthesizes their history in order to answer these questions and offer a thoughtful perspective on how we might apply the concepts today. While they belong to the same history and are often conflated, fascism and populism actually represent distinct political&amp;#160;trajectories. Drawing on an expansive record of transnational fascism and postwar populist movements, Finchelstein gives us insightful new ways to think about the state of democracy and political culture on a global scale.&amp;#160;This new edition includes an updated preface that brings the book&amp;#160;up to date, midway through the Trump presidency and the election of Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil.&amp;#160;" />
