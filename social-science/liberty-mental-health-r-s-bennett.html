  <title>Liberty &amp; Mental Health - R S Bennett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Is the government driving people crazy? Liberty &amp; Mental Health - You Cant Have One Without the Other - gives ways to restore sanity both to individuals - and to government. 
The situation those with mental health problems find themselves in can be considered a microcosm of larger social problems. While most complain of how little those on opposite sides of the political spectrum work together, often it is their shared view that the rich and powerful must be pampered while their abuses are denied, covered-up, excused and then justified which prevent true reform. Washington D.C. seems to be primarily inhabited by lawyers who constantly offer up scapegoats to explain away failures of policy and law.
TOPICS
Many studies show 25% of those diagnosed as mentally ill have physical conditions causing or exacerbating psychiatric disorders.  One study showed 75%.  Role trauma &amp; poor diet play in onset.  
Programs and psychologists who can help instead of hinder.
The medicine of the future is now available.
Lack of knowledge in political and economic theory is preventing liberals and conservatives from working together.
Have Supreme Court decisions lead to the rise in crime and distrust of government?
Moral authority in the 21st century." />
