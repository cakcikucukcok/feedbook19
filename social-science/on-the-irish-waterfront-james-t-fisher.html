  <title>On the Irish Waterfront - James T. Fisher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Site of the world&#39;s busiest and most lucrative harbor throughout the first half of the twentieth century, the Port of New York was also the historic preserve of Irish American gangsters, politicians, longshoremen&#39;s union leaders, and powerful Roman Catholic pastors. This is the demimonde depicted to stunning effect in Elia Kazan&#39;s &lt;em&gt;On the Waterfront&lt;/em&gt; (1954) and into which James T. Fisher takes readers in this remarkable and engaging historical account of the classic film&#39;s backstory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;Fisher introduces readers to the real &quot;Father Pete Barry&quot; featured in &lt;em&gt;On the Waterfront&lt;/em&gt;, John M. &quot;Pete&quot; Corridan, a crusading priest committed to winning union democracy and social justice for the port&#39;s dockworkers and their families. A Jesuit labor school instructor, not a parish priest, Corridan was on but not of Manhattan&#39;s West Side Irish waterfront. His ferocious advocacy was resisted by the very men he sought to rescue from the violence and criminality that rendered the port &quot;a jungle, an outlaw frontier,&quot; in the words of investigative reporter Malcolm Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;Driven off the waterfront, Corridan forged creative and spiritual alliances with men like Johnson and Budd Schulberg, the screenwriter who worked with Corridan for five years to turn Johnson&#39;s Pulitzer Prize-winning 1948 newspaper exposé into a movie. Fisher&#39;s detailed account of the waterfront priest&#39;s central role in the film&#39;s creation challenges standard views of the film as a post facto justification for Kazan and Schulberg&#39;s testimony as ex-communists before the House Committee on Un-American Activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the Irish Waterfront&lt;/em&gt; is also a detailed social history of the New York/New Jersey waterfront, from the rise of Irish American entrepreneurs and political bosses during the World War I era to the mid-1950s, when the emergence of a revolutionary new mode of cargo-shipping signaled a radical reorganization of the port. This book explores the conflicts experienced and accommodations made by an insular Irish-Catholic community forced to adapt its economic, political, and religious lives to powerful forces of change both local and global in scope.&lt;/p&gt;" />
