  <title>Paddy Machiavelli – How to Get Ahead in Irish Politics - John Drennan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The good, the bad and the cynical &amp;ndash; how to get ahead in Irish politics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It might appear strange that a 16th-century Italian political philosopher should provide us with a roadmap to political power in Ireland, but as John Drennan’s tongue-in-cheek account &lt;i&gt;Paddy Machiavelli&lt;/i&gt; makes clear, the gap between the parish pump and the Renaissance palazzo is a narrow one indeed. In fact, observe the Irish body politic for long enough and the lines between the Florentine’s faceless hero and our own D&amp;aacute;il aristocrats begin to blur ever so slightly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A veteran of countless Leinster House power plays, Drennan takes inspiration from Machiavelli’s &lt;i&gt;The Prince&lt;/i&gt;, dispensing invaluable advice for the aspiring politician, such as how to cultivate the cloak of being an ‘ordinary decent skin’, how to choose your scapegoats carefully, and how to be a straight-talker whilst embracing vagueness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This hilarious account of the compromises that the Irish politician has to make in order to seize power is not just a ‘celebration’ of the politics of cynical amorality; it’s a timely reminder of the role we play in choosing our leaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this wildly entertaining book, celebrated &lt;i&gt;Sunday Independent&lt;/i&gt; columnist John Drennan is at his best.
