  <title>Indian Blood: HIV and Colonial Trauma in San Francisco&#39;s Two-Spirit Community - Andrew J. Jolivétte</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;The first book to examine the correlation between mixed-race identity and HIV/AIDS among Native American gay men and transgendered people, Indian Blood provides an analysis of the emerging and often contested LGBTQ &quot;two-spirit&quot; identification as it relates to public health and mixed-race identity.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Prior to contact with European settlers, most Native American tribes held their two-spirit members in high esteem, even considering them spiritually advanced. However, after contact - and religious conversion - attitudes changed and social and cultural support networks were ruptured. This discrimination led to a breakdown in traditional values, beliefs, and practices, which in turn pushed many two-spirit members to participate in high-risk behaviors. The result is a disproportionate number of two-spirit members who currently test positive for HIV.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Using surveys, focus groups, and community discussions to examine the experiences of HIV-positive members of San Francisco&#39;s two-spirit community, Indian Blood provides an innovative approach to understanding how colonization continues to affect American Indian communities and opens a series of crucial dialogues in the fields of Native American studies, public health, queer studies, and critical mixed-race studies.&lt;/P&gt;" />
