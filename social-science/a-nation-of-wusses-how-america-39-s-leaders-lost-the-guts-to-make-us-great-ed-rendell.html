Most politicians and bureaucrats can see no further ahead than the next election, sometimes no further than the next press conference. Americans are rarely afraid of sacrifice and hard work when they mean building a better future, but when was the last time you heard of a leader of anything making a sacrifice for the greater good? The people can only win when they make it clear to the powers that be that making the right choices, even the hard ones, is the key to winning the next election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explains in rollicking stories ranging from the profane to the profound that most hard choices are only &quot;hard&quot; because the polls conflict with your principles &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ed Rendell rose to the top of Philadelphia, then Pennsylvania, then national politics, by doing what he thought was right, and there were plenty of times that looked like it would be his downfall as well &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This book revisits the high points of Ed Rendell&#39;s career and current landscape to define the political fights his peers seem just as afraid of winning as losing &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rendell is a former head of the Democratic National Committee, a current MSNBC Senior Political Analyst, and a Partner at Ballard Spahr LLP&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;" />
