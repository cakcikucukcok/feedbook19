  <title>The Sixth Sense - Charles Henry Brent</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;ldquo; The only real valuable thing is intuition.&amp;rdquo; - Albert Einstein&lt;br /&gt;
Your sixth sense is the world inside your head &amp;ndash; the world of intuition or psychic power. It is a super sense, the cumulative power of all your other senses: sight, hearing, touch, smell and hearing. It&amp;rsquo;s also an amazing source of creative power, understanding and insight. Everyone can tune into their sixth sense, but most choose to ignore it.&lt;br /&gt;
Charles Henry Brent published more than twenty books. His works reveal a man absorbed in the problems and mysteries of the inner life. His book on the sixth sense is hugely interesting.&lt;br /&gt;
Excerpt:&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo; Mystic Sense, likewise, first comes to our attention as a simple faculty of perception by which we gain cognition of that department of reality that transcends bodily touch and its sub-divisions, but study reveals that its unity is ordered complexity,&amp;nbsp;as in the case of all developed endowments. Broadly speaking it is the sense which relates man to the spiritual or psychic aspect of reality. It puts us into relation with the spiritual order of which we are a part. It finds room for exercise, gains its freedom, and reaches its highest development in this sphere, beginning operations at the point where the bodily senses are compelled by inherent limitations to halt. It discerns the innermost character, use, value of the objective, and differentiates between the human and the animal estimate of things. Indeed it has in it that which is not of this world or order. It soars beyond human and mundane affairs and steeps its wings in Divine altitudes where the throne of God is set. Not only does it perceive but it also lays hold of and appropriates that phase of reality which lies beyond the unaided reach, or eludes the grasp, of all the rest of our faculties in their happiest combination, and therefore of any one of them independently.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
