  <title>It&#39;s Not About the Money - Brent Kessel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What do the latest financial thinking and ancient spiritual teachings reveal to us about financial freedom? Top financial advisor Brent Kessel insists financial success and security is &quot;not about the money.&quot; Rather, it&#39;s about what&#39;s inside us&amp;#8212;first understanding your emotional relationship to money, and only then taking action. &lt;em&gt;It&#39;s Not About the Money&lt;/em&gt; expertly and compassionately guides you along the path to financial security and true peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kessel, founder of two top wealth-management firms, has the inside scoop on the higher wisdom of personal finances, and he wants to share it with you. Through extensive experience as a financial advisor and spiritual seeker, Kessel has discovered that people need to understand their core financial story in order to make meaningful changes. Some of us are savers or caretakers, says Kessel, while others are pleasure seekers and spend like Hollywood stars; some people are idealists who place greater value on creativity or compassion than on financial security; some of us innocently believe our finances will work out without effort; and others obsess about building empires with lasting value. &lt;em&gt;It&#39;s Not About the Money&lt;/em&gt; will help you identify your money type, providing information and resources as well as exercises and meditations to inspire a fresh approach to your relationship with money that will change your life. &lt;/p&gt;" />
