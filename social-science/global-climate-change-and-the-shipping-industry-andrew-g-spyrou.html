  <title>Global Climate Change and the Shipping Industry - Andrew G. Spyrou</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Environmentalists want industrialized nations to reduce the emission of greenhouse
gases that warm the atmosphere. For more than twenty years, however,
their pleas have been mostly ignored.
Naval architects and ship designers can play a critical role in reducing greenhouse
gases by designing effi cient ships that are safe and environment friendly.
New innovations would enhance fuel effi ciency and encourage other industries
to adopt new ways of thinking.
Ship designers are already working to develop a ship that is safe, effi cient and
ecologically friendly. Discover why these efforts are so important, and also
learn the following:
 Ways a realistic and practical carbon dioxide index for ships can be
established
 How much pollution commercial ships cause
 How safety concerns and other variables affect ship design
 What new designs could mean for the environment
There is a great deal of uncertainty about why climates are changing, but this
does not mean theories revolving around global warming are wrong. Discover
new approaches to solve the problem, and take steps to understand the stakes
involved with Global Climate Change and the Shipping Industry." />
