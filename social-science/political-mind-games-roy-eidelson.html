That&amp;rsquo;s how so many have come to believe that climate change is a hoax, taxes are too high, the military budget is too low, public education needs privatization, workers have it too easy, voter fraud is everywhere, healthcare isn&amp;rsquo;t a fundamental right, poverty is deserved, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognizing and countering the 1%&amp;rsquo;s destructive mind games&amp;mdash;including &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a Dangerous World,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re Fighting Injustice,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;They&amp;rsquo;re Devious and Dishonest,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Change is Impossible&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;is an urgent matter for anyone interested in charting a different course.
