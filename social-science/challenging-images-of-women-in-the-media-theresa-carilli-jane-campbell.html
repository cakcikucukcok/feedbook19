  <title>Challenging Images of Women in the Media - Theresa Carilli, Jane Campbell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Challenging Images of Women and the Media: Reinventing Women&amp;rsquo;s Lives&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, edited by Theresa Carilli and Jane Campbell, collects fifteen articles addressing the status of women through an examination of depictions of women in the media. This in-depth study shows how mixed messages from the media muddle attempts at breaking the &amp;ldquo;glass screen,&amp;rdquo; causing women to constantly question their role in global culture. With cake ads followed by diet commercials, the media&amp;rsquo;s depiction of women is both confusing and contradictory. While more and more women have begun to contribute to the media as respected anchors, talk show hosts, and commentators, these portrayals are often counteracted by music videos and reality television shows such as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Jersey Shore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. This collection seeks to analyze these depictions and their effects on women and culture. The contributors to this anthology hail from such diverse locations as Japan, Australia, Pakistan, India, China, Bulgaria, and the United States. With this global focus, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Challenging Images of Women in the Media&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; scrutinizes issues of race, ethnicity, class, and sexuality through a study of gendered media portrayals. By challenging the status quo of media images, the contributors to this essential volume invite a dialogue about women&amp;rsquo;s lives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
