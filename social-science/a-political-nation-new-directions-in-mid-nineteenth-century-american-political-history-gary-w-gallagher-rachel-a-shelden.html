  <title>A Political Nation: New Directions in Mid-Nineteenth-Century American Political History - Gary W. Gallagher, Rachel A. Shelden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This impressive collection joins the recent outpouring of exciting new     work on American politics and political actors in the mid-nineteenth century. For several     generations, much of the scholarship on the political history of the period from 1840 to 1877     has carried a theme of failure; after all, politicians in the antebellum years failed to prevent     war, and those of the Civil War and Reconstruction failed to take advantage of opportunities to     remake the nation. Moving beyond these older debates, the essays in this volume ask new     questions about mid-nineteenth-century American politics and     politicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;A Political Nation,&lt;/i&gt; the     contributors address the dynamics of political parties and factions, illuminate the presence of     consensus and conflict in American political life, and analyze elections, voters, and issues. In     addition to examining the structures of the United States Congress, state and local governments,     and other political organizations, this collection emphasizes political leaders-those who made     policy, ran for office, influenced elections, and helped to shape American life from the early     years of the Second Party System to the turbulent period of     Reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book moves chronologically, beginning     with an antebellum focus on how political actors behaved within their cultural surroundings. The     authors then use the critical role of language, rhetoric, and ideology in mid-nineteenth-century     political culture as a lens through which to reevaluate the secession crisis. The collection     closes with an examination of cultural and institutional influences on politicians in the Civil     War and Reconstruction years. Stressing the role of federalism in understanding American     political behavior, &lt;i&gt;A Political Nation&lt;/i&gt; underscores the vitality of     scholarship on mid-nineteenth-century American     politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contributors:&lt;br&gt;Erik B.
