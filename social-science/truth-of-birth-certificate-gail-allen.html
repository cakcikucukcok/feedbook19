That led me to pursue with my research on the governments of Australia. Are history show, the federal government was formed by the people of this great nation. The problem today, the people of Australia does not know that the commonwealth federal government and as such all Australia own their government by voting for them. This reason why we have election every three years. We choose a new government to whats right for all of us. As for me, I am a member of the Australia resistance. Agana the UN Companys government and the social engineering of the desecration of our country.&lt;br /&gt;I carry with me 3 very imported books, the bible, constitution and magna cart law.&lt;br /&gt;These books will become Australia saviour.&lt;/p&gt;" />
