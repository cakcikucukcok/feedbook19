  <title>The Future of Cooperation between the United States and Pakistan - Sadika Hameed</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The relationship between the United States and Pakistan has been redefined repeatedly since Pakistan&amp;rsquo;s independence in 1947. It will continue to be strained by mutual distrust, internal threats to Pakistan&amp;rsquo;s stability, Pakistan&amp;rsquo;s relations with its neighbors and militants, and the U.S. role in Afghanistan beyond 2014. But there is a growing recognition that the U.S.-Pakistan relationship is one of mutual necessity&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;transactional&amp;rdquo; rather than &amp;ldquo;strategic.&amp;rdquo; This pragmatic recognition, along with recent developments (such as the peaceful transfer of power between elected civilian governments, the military&amp;rsquo;s declining prestige, and the political establishment&amp;rsquo;s growing willingness to engage constructively with India) and ongoing pressures (such as Pakistan&amp;rsquo;s youth bulge and energy crisis), give the United States and Pakistan a chance to focus on areas where cooperation is actually possible: civilian aid, trade relations, and support to Pakistan&amp;rsquo;s private sector. The author based these findings on interviews and rountables involving more than 220 officials and experts during a two-month field visit in Pakistan in late 2012.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
