  <title>Guns, Gun Control, and Elections: The Politics and Policy of Firearms - Harry L. Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Gun-related violence remains an intractable problem despite a decline in the past decade. Some believe the solution lies in stricter gun control laws while others think these measures would be ineffective or counter-productive. &lt;i&gt;Guns, Gun Control, and Elections&lt;/i&gt; examines current gun control policy and explains how it was adopted by discussing the roles and interactions of elected officials, interest groups, political parties, and the public. Original research on media coverage and public opinion as well as a chapter on state policy (Virginia) make the book both informative and accessible. The book focuses on the utility of gun policy, and its discussion of policy impact is grounded in real-world politics. The author highlights the importance of gun control in the presidential elections of 2000 and 2004 as well as in some U.S. Senate and statewide campaigns." />
