  <title>American Foreign Policy - Glenn P. Hastedt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Glenn Hastedt&amp;rsquo;s clear and succinct introduction to the field prepares students to think about America&amp;rsquo;s changing role in the world and to develop the critical thinking skills needed to participate in the debate about the conduct and content of American foreign policy. He begins by asking &amp;ldquo;What do we mean by foreign policy and what is the national interest?&amp;rdquo; Next, Hastedt looks to the past and examines the defining experiences that have helped to shape American foreign policy today. Third, he looks at how American foreign policy is made in the current hyperpartisan political climate. Here Hastedt examines the various institutions and how they come together to make policy, as well as the policy instruments available to decision makers. And finally, he encourages students to wonder, &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s next?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eleventh edition reflects the latest headlines, including more extensive discussions of hybrid warfare, cyber wars, drones, and an assessment of Obama&amp;rsquo;s foreign policy. There are new case studies on ISIS, authorization of force resolutions, women in combat, the climate agreement, the Iran nuclear agreement, Obama&amp;rsquo;s opening to Cuba, and the future of COIN. And new Historical Lessons boxes feature the War Powers Act, the integration of the military, the Kyoto Agreement, NAFTA, and Afghanistan. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This book is accompanied by a learning package designed to enhance the experience of both instructors and students: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Test Bank.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; The Test Bank includes a variety of test questions and is available in either Word, PDF or Respondus formats. For every chapter in the text, the Test Bank includes a complete test with a variety of question types, including multiple choice, true false, and essay formats. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our Test Bank is most flexibly used in Respondus, test authoring software which is available in two forms. Check with your university to see if you have a site license to the full program, Respondus 4.0, which offers the option to upload your tests to any of the most popular course management systems such as Blackboard. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have a Respondus license or do not care about having your tests in a course management system, you can use our test bank file in Respondus LE. The LE program is free and can be used to automate the process of creating tests in print format. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;bull; Visit the Respondus Test Bank Network to download the test bank for either Respondus 4.0 or Respondus LE. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;bull; If you prefer to use our Test Bank in Word or PDF, please Sign-In if you are a registered user, or Register then email us at &lt;a style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot; href=&quot;mailto:textbooks@rowman.com&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;textbooks@rowman.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Companion Website.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Accompanying the text is an open-access Companion Website designed to reinforce the main topics.
