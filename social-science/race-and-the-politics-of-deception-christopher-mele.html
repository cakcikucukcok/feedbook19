  <title>Race and the Politics of Deception - Christopher Mele</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What is the relationship between race and space, and how do racial politics inform the organization and development of urban locales?&amp;nbsp; In &lt;em&gt;Race and the Politics of Deception&lt;/em&gt;, Christopher Mele unpacks America&amp;#8217;s history of dealing with racial problems through the inequitable use of public space.&amp;nbsp; Mele focuses on Chester, Pennsylvania&amp;#8212;a small city comprised of primarily low-income, black residents, roughly twenty miles south of Philadelphia.&amp;nbsp; Like many cities throughout the United States, Chester is experiencing post-industrial decline.&amp;nbsp; A development plan touted as a way to &amp;#8220;save&amp;#8221; the city, proposes to turn one section into a desirable waterfront destination, while leaving the rest of the struggling residents in fractured communities.&amp;nbsp; Dividing the city into spaces of tourism and consumption versus the everyday spaces of low-income residents, Mele argues, segregates the community by creating a racialized divide.&amp;nbsp; While these development plans are described as socially inclusive and economically revitalizing, Mele asserts that political leaders and real estate developers intentionally exclude certain types of people&amp;#8212;most often, low-income people of color.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Race and the Politics of Deception&lt;/em&gt; provides a revealing look at how our ever-changing landscape is being strategically divided along lines of class and race." />
