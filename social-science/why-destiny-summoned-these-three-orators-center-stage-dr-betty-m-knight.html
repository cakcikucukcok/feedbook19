  <title>Why Destiny Summoned These Three Orators Center Stage - Dr. Betty M. Knight</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book was written based on Betty Knights ability to balance and critically analyze three of these orators speeches made during three different eras of American history.  Her insights allow readers to see what I saw immediately after speaking with on her on many occasions:  her unique way of interpreting the past, present, and the future.   The deposit that Knight has made to her readers lives will demonstrate that she is not among the many but among the few; for many are called, but few are chosen.  
After reading her other book W.H.O.L.E., I realized that Betty Knight had something to say to the class of 2010 and her colleagues in the ministry.  So I asked her to be the keynote speaker at her own graduation in Chicago, Illinois on September 11, 2010.  She agreed.  Her keynote address was entitled If you can wait your time, you will have your turn.    Knight has received her Doctorate of Philosophy in Ministry.  After reading her thesis, I truly understand why God has equipped her to have an impact on her audience as well as keep it present throughout this experience.
In this book, Knight addresses how Christianity and the United States Constitution stand somewhat at odds with each other while sometimes forming a bond, those of creative mind and genius that make it possible for them to deal together with key problems of American history.  Knights writing brings this theme center stage, including the many contradictions within Christianity as a religious institution and interpretations of its sacred text, the Bible, from which, a way of life was drawn by those who attempted to understand and practice Christianity within Western culture. This book enables the reader to understand when and how to reconcile these contradictions.  In addition, the book identifies basic essentials for life, its governance, and its survival  all to be viewed from the perspective of numerous identifying principles that have caused alienation within American life.  When you finish reading this book you will completely understand why God called these African Americans orators Douglass, King, and Obama center stage." />
