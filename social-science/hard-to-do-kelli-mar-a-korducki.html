  <title>Hard To Do - Kelli María Korducki</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever the underlying motives&amp;#151;be they love, financial security, or mere masochism&amp;#151;the fact is that getting involved in a romantic partnership is emotionally, morally, and even politically fraught. In &lt;I&gt;Hard To Do&lt;/I&gt;, Kelli Mar&amp;#236;a Korducki turns a Marxist lens on the relatively short history of romantic love, tracing how the myth of economic equality between men and women has transformed the ways women conceive of domestic partnership. With perceptive, reported insights on the ways marriage and divorce are legislated, the rituals of twentieth-century courtship, and contemporary practices for calling it off, Korducki reveals that, for all women, choosing to end a relationship is a radical action with very limited cultural precedent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;Kelli Mar&amp;#236;a Korducki&lt;/B&gt; is a journalist and cultural critic.
