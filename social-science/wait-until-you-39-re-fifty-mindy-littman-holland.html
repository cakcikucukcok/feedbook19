  <title>Wait Until You&#39;re Fifty - Mindy Littman Holland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If you think your forties were challenging-wait until you&#39;re fifty. Just don&#39;t wait until you&#39;re fifty to read this book. It&#39;s easier to handle this momentous change of life if you&#39;re armed with good information, a sense of humor and, perhaps, a stiff drink. Fifty doesn&#39;t happen overnight-the journey into midlife takes years and it&#39;s different for everybody, female and male. Some start earlier, some start later, but in the end, it&#39;s all the same: By the time you&#39;re fifty adjustments are called for. This book is about helping women (and men, to some extent) navigate the changes that midlife brings. It gives credence, validity and voice to real concerns about entering middle age and practical advice on preserving and/or improving minds, bodies, desirability, confidence and creativity going forward. The book covers a broad range of topics from the perspective of midlife veterans, members of a silent majority of women that have a lot more to talk about than hot flashes and other physical manifestations of middle age. It is characterized by straightforward, conversational language, humorous anecdotes, helpful suggestions and an unwavering focus on reality, no matter how controversial or unorthodox. Women are hungry to hear about other women&#39;s experiences in this area-and men are anxious to learn how to relate to the changing women in their lives as they are going through their own changes. They are all looking for relief-comic and otherwise. &quot;Wait Until You&#39;re Fifty&quot; focuses less on menopause and more on the perspective changes, little murders and unexpected awakenings that midlife precipitates, such as: the permanently empty nest (farewell to fertility), midlife love (a whole other affair), and re-prioritizing friendship (who will be there for the back fifty?). MINDY LITTMAN HOLLAND wrote this book based on personal experience and interviews with dozens of women and men who had something to say about the joys and adversities of midlife. In addition to writing non-fiction, she writes long and short fiction. She lives in Santa Fe, New Mexico." />
