  <title>The Farmer&#39;s Benevolent Trust - Victoria Saker Woeste</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Americans have always regarded farming as a special calling, one&lt;br/&gt;imbued with the Jeffersonian values of individualism and self-&lt;br/&gt;sufficiency. As Victoria Saker Woeste demonstrates, farming&#39;s&lt;br/&gt;cultural image continued to shape Americans&#39; expectations of&lt;br/&gt;rural society long after industrialization radically transformed&lt;br/&gt;the business of agriculture. Even as farmers enthusiastically&lt;br/&gt;embraced cooperative marketing to create unprecedented industry-&lt;br/&gt;wide monopolies and control prices, they claimed they were simply&lt;br/&gt;preserving their traditional place in society. In fact, the new&lt;br/&gt;legal form of cooperation far outpaced judicial and legislative&lt;br/&gt;developments at both the state and federal levels, resulting in a&lt;br/&gt;legal and political struggle to redefine the place of agriculture&lt;br/&gt;in the industrial market.&lt;br/&gt;     Woeste shows that farmers were adept at both borrowing such&lt;br/&gt;legal forms as the corporate trust for their own purposes and&lt;br/&gt;obtaining legislative recognition of the new cooperative style.&lt;br/&gt;In the process, however, the first rule of capitalism--every&lt;br/&gt;person for him- or herself--trumped the traditional principle of&lt;br/&gt;cooperation. After 1922, state and federal law wholly endorsed&lt;br/&gt;cooperation&#39;s new form. Indeed, says Woeste, because of its&lt;br/&gt;corporate roots, this model of cooperation fit so neatly with the&lt;br/&gt;regulatory paradigms of the first half of the twentieth century&lt;br/&gt;that it became an essential policy of the modern administrative&lt;br/&gt;state.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
