  <title>Dichotomy of the Black Diaspora - Lee Catubay Paul</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The investigation in &lt;em&gt;Dichotomy of the Black Diaspora&lt;/em&gt; covers a broad sweep of history, geographically scattered settings, influences both personal and communal, and outcomes touching religion, politics, and education. By looking so broadly and deeply, Lee Catubay Paul presents a thorough study of the realities of the Black Diaspora, depicting the dichotomy that runs through the tapestry of Black history and experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After setting the background and exploring its nuances and details, &lt;em&gt;Dichotomy of the Black Diaspora&lt;/em&gt; sets out the dichotomy, in which some members of the Black community choose to focus on temporal matters while others attend to their spiritual roots. In the end, one hears a call for Black people to recognize the reality of the dichotomy they face and to confront it: As a people, it is important that they accept the bitter with the sweet in life.  They need to lift themselves up and use the bitter afflictions of the past as a catalyst to give them an impetus to help fortify the Black Diaspora.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you find yourself among the members of the Black Diaspora or you desire to understand the foundations and ramifications of this key element of humanitys shared history, &lt;em&gt;Dichotomy of the Black Diaspora&lt;/em&gt; will provide you with the background, context, reflection, and direction you need to see this phenomenon clearly and to understand it and its influences.&lt;/p&gt;" />
