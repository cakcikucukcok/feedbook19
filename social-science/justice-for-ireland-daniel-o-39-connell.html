  <title>Justice for Ireland - Daniel O&#39;Connell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Daniel O&amp;#39;Connell (6 August 1775 &amp;ndash; 15 May 1847), often referred to as The Liberator or The Emancipator, was an Irish political leader in the first half of the 19th century. He campaigned for Catholic emancipation&amp;mdash;including the right for Catholics to sit in the Westminster Parliament, denied for over 100 years&amp;mdash;and repeal of the Acts of Union which combined Great Britain and Ireland.&lt;br /&gt;
Throughout his career in Irish politics, O&amp;#39;Connell was able to gain a large following among the Irish masses in support of him and his Catholic Association. O&amp;#39;Connell&amp;#39;s main strategy was one of political reformism, working within the parliamentary structures of the British state in Ireland and forming an alliance of convenience with the Whigs. More radical elements broke with O&amp;#39;Connell to found the Young Ireland movement. On February 4, 1836, he gave this speech in the House of Commons calling for equal justice.&lt;br /&gt;
