  <title>&#39;Is It Global War on Terrorism&#39; or Global War over Terra Africana? - Nkwazi Nkuzi Mhango</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lsquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Global War on Terrorism&amp;rsquo; or Global War over Terra Africana?: How Imperial Powers Seek to Occupy Africa Militarily&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is a long, onerous academic voyage of the demystification and demythologization of the Global War on Terror former US president&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;George W Bush and former UK premier Tony Blair&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;conceived, envisaged and declared for their hidden personal and national interests. It is a hidden and untold story of the other side about the GWOT which is but the GWOTA. Major arguments presented gyrate around the deconstruction; and overhaul of the GWOT so that it can be equally formulated and fought by all nations for the interests of all but not the interests of some as it currently is. Also, the book repudiates the pontification the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;pontifices maximus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; of the GWOTA have always made &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;ex nihilo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; while concealing their drive[s] for perpetually exploiting poor countries. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Terrorism is a world phenomenon everybody must fight provided it is collectively agreed, decided and declared for the collective good and interests of the world but not the interests of a few hegemonic countries that usurped the power of declaring who is a terrorist and who is not. Although terrorism is real, the manner it is fought is a little bit knotty. This tome acts as an eye opener and a wake-up call for Africa to start interrogating and excavating the hidden truths about the GWOT chiefly the way it was enacted, declared, presented and now fought with essentialist and controversialist &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;modus operandi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; and rationale. Other major questions asked and answered are: Why exporting military and military hardware guised as fighting terrorism without underscoring the terror military incursion will, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;inter alia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, cause to Africa especially? If truly the aim of the GWOT is to wage war on terror, why doesn&amp;rsquo;t the West want to empower African armies? Why did the US appoint itself to lead the war conceived and declared without meeting the requirements of the just war or international standards? Why hasn&amp;rsquo;t the world learned from Iraq and Libya whose governments were toppled under the fa&amp;ccedil;ade of the GWOT? Is it the GWOT or the GWOTA?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
