  <title>The Waiver of the Illegal Aliens: - Hugo Aguilera</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Denying oneself is the pleasure of writing to give all honors to our LORD JESUS CHRIST AMEN, AMEN AND AMEN.
This book seeks to simplify for the understanding of all readers the identification of the diverse forms and ways of how people enter, legally or illegally, into the United States of America.
All promoters who are in favor of the pardon for all who enter with or without apocryphal documents to this country, have in mind two prejudicial reasons for the future of this nation. On one hand, to refine a strong anarchist character by praising all who violate the law with legal residence; on the other hand to swell the ranks of the Democratic party with corporative votes of gratitude for being the promoter of these unprecedented amendments which go against established law in force when they entered the United States of America, and instead of being deported, they are made residents.
All of these results in political inequity and thins out significantly the IDENTITY of the future citizens of the United States of America, since its first immigrants were diametrically different in culture, beliefs and language, and in which the Democratic President Jimmy Carter took advantage of in its time, by forming an enormous corporative block of votes which complicates the situation for Republicans to overcome in the next electoral contest for President of this nation." />
