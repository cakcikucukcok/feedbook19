  <title>Up Your Ass - Valerie Solanas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Up Your Ass&quot;, never before published, is the avant-garde play script by radical feminist Valerie Solanas that catapulted her to shoot Andy Warhol in 1968. Solanas gave this provocative satire to Warhol in the hopes that he would produce it. But when he lost it Solanas became convinced that he and his Factory friends were conspiring against her. Eventually, she barged into the Factory with a pistol and shot both Warhol and Mario Amaya, an art critic, resulting in her incarceration in a Bellevue Hospital psychiatric ward. &quot;Up Your Ass&quot; is a humorous portrait of everyday sexism through the eyes of a bitter hustling prostitute. Clearly inspired by her own experiences, this script, is not only wildly outrageous, but eerily relevant and almost prophetic, forty-nine years after it was first written." />
