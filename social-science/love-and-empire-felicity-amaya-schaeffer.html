  <title>Love and Empire - Felicity Amaya Schaeffer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;The spread of the Internet is remaking marriage markets, altering the  process of courtship and the geographic trajectory of intimacy in the  21st century. For some Latin American women and U.S. men, the advent of  the cybermarriage industry offers new opportunities for re-making  themselves and their futures, overthrowing the common narrative of  trafficking and exploitation. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In this engaging, stimulating virtual  ethnography, Felicity Amaya Schaeffer follows couples&amp;#8217; romantic  interludes at &amp;#8220;Vacation Romance Tours,&amp;#8221; in chat rooms, and interviews  married couples in the United States in order to understand the  commercialization of intimacy. While attending to the interplay between  the everyday and the virtual, &lt;em&gt;Love and Empire&lt;/em&gt; contextualizes  personal desires within the changing global economic and political  shifts across the Americas. By examining current immigration policies  and the use of Mexican and Colombian women as erotic icons of the nation  in the global marketplace, she forges new relations between intimate  imaginaries and state policy in the making of new markets, finding that  women&amp;#8217;s erotic self-fashioning is the form through which women become  ideal citizens, of both their home countries and in the United States.  Through these little-explored, highly mediated romantic exchanges, &lt;em&gt;Love and Empire&lt;/em&gt; unveils a fresh perspective on the continually evolving relationship between the U.S. and Latin America. &lt;/div&gt;" />
