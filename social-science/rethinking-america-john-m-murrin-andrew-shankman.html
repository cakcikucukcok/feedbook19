  <title>Rethinking America - John M. Murrin, Andrew Shankman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For five decades John M. Murrin has been the consummate historian&#39;s historian.  This volume brings together his seminal essays on the American Revolution, the United States Constitution, and the early American Republic.  Collectively, they rethink fundamental questions regarding American identity, the decision to declare independence in 1776, and the impact the American Revolution had on the nation it produced.
By digging deeply into questions that have shaped the field for several generations, &lt;em&gt;Rethinking America&lt;/em&gt; argues that high politics and the study of constitutional and ideological questions--broadly the history of elites--must be considered in close conjunction with issues of economic inequality, class conflict, and racial division. Bringing together different schools of history and a variety of perspectives on both Britain and the North American colonies, it explains why what began as a constitutional argument, that virtually all expected would remain contained within the British Empire, exploded into a truly subversive and radical revolution that destroyed monarchy and aristocracy and replaced them with a rapidly transforming and chaotic republic.  This volume examines the period of the early American Republic and discusses why the Founders&#39; assumptions about what their Revolution would produce were profoundly different than the society that emerged from the American Revolution.  In many ways, Rethinking America suggests that the outcome of the American Revolution put the new United States on a path to a violent and bloody civil war.
With an introduction by Andrew Shankman, this long-awaited work by one of the most important scholars of the Revolutionary era offers a coherent interpretation of the complex period that saw the breakdown of colonial British North America and the founding of the United States." />
