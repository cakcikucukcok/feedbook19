  <title>Ambivalent Miracles: Evangelicals and the Politics of Racial Healing - Nancy D. Wadsworth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past three decades, American evangelical Christians have     undergone unexpected, progressive shifts in the area of race relations, culminating in a     national movement that advocates racial integration and equality in evangelical communities. The     movement, which seeks to build cross-racial relationships among evangelicals, has meant     challenging well-established paradigms of church growth that built many megachurch empires.     While evangelical racial change (ERC) efforts have never been easy and their reception has been     mixed, they have produced meaningful transformation in religious communities. Although the     movement as a whole encompasses a broad range of political views, many participants are     interested in addressing race-related political issues that impact their members, such as     immigration, law enforcement, and public education policy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     &lt;i&gt;Ambivalent Miracles&lt;/i&gt; traces the rise and ongoing evolution of evangelical     racial change efforts within the historical, political, and cultural contexts that have shaped     them. Nancy D. Wadsworth argues that the stunning breakthroughs this movement has achieved, its     curious political ambivalence, and its internal tensions are products of a complex cultural     politics constructed at the intersection of U.S. racial and religious history and the     meaning-making practices of conservative evangelicalism. Employing methods from the emerging     field of political ethnography, Wadsworth draws from a decade&#39;s worth of interviews and     participant observation in ERC settings, textual analysis, and survey research, as well as a     three-year case study, to provide the first exhaustive treatment of ERC efforts in political     science. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2014 CHOICE Outstanding Academic     Title&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
