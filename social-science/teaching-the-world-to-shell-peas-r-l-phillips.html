  <title>Teaching the World to Shell Peas - R. L. Phillips</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Surely, God did not allow African Americans to experience oppression for over four hundred years just for us to dwell in an exclusive neighborhood, acquire material possessions, attain middle class status, or be a famous black first.  African Americans are not in America to imitate our white brothers and sisters. Our situation is unique. We are insiders and outsiders, Americans and of African descent, free and unfree. We are a split people seeking wholeness. By bringing new insights into the life of African Americans, Rev. Phillips uses a number of case studies of his former high school students to reveal the severity of the split in the life of the students and their community at large.  He contends that if we do not attain true wholeness, our unresolved conflicts would harm us psychologically and spiritually, which in turn could detrimentally affect us socially, politically and economically. Many have already become hopeless and mentally challenged.  Our educational and social problems are troublesome. Despite our progress in America, many are still experiencing a meaningless life and are seeking answers. How can one attain wholeness in a materialistic and black phobic world?  Rev. Phillips takes us on an engaging journey to discover the answer." />
