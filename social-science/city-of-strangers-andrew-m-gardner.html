  <title>City of Strangers - Andrew M. Gardner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;In &lt;em&gt;City of Strangers&lt;/em&gt;, Andrew M. Gardner explores the everyday experiences of workers from India who have migrated to the Kingdom of Bahrain. Like all the petroleum-rich states of the Persian Gulf, Bahrain hosts an extraordinarily large population of transmigrant laborers. Guest workers, who make up nearly half of the country&#39;s population, have long labored under a sponsorship system, the &lt;em&gt;kafala&lt;/em&gt;, that organizes the flow of migrants from South Asia to the Gulf states and contractually links each laborer to a specific citizen or institution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;In order to remain in Bahrain, the worker is almost entirely dependent on his sponsor&#39;s goodwill. The nature of this relationship, Gardner contends, often leads to exploitation and sometimes violence. Through extensive observation and interviews Gardner focuses on three groups in Bahrain: the unskilled Indian laborers who make up the most substantial portion of the foreign workforce on the island; the country&#39;s entrepreneurial and professional Indian middle class; and Bahraini state and citizenry. He contends that the social segregation and structural violence produced by Bahrain&#39;s &lt;em&gt;kafala&lt;/em&gt; system result from a strategic arrangement by which the state insulates citizens from the global and neoliberal flows that, paradoxically, are central to the nation&#39;s intended path to the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;em&gt;City of Strangers&lt;/em&gt; contributes significantly to our understanding of politics and society among the states of the Arabian Peninsula and of the migrant labor phenomenon that is an increasingly important aspect of globalization.&lt;/p&gt;" />
