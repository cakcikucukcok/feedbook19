He is a masterful storyteller, combining theology, sociology, history, scripture and church architecture into a masterpiece. Writing about the struggle of a suburban parish to build an edifice, the author cites numerous parallels between the Israelites history and that of the parish.&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;He recasts the Israelites story into the contemporary, making the Bible relevant in demonstrating the ongoing work of God.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

He addresses the tension between West Indians and black Americans and notes the latters significant contribution to the Episcopal Church.&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;He recognizes the indelible contribution of the first African Americans who penetrated the white enclave of Cambria Heights. Recognition is also made of black Episcopalians for their valuable contribution to the society &lt;SPAN style=&quot;COLOR: black&quot;&gt;and for challenging the church to be honest to its Catholicity, insisting that they (black Episcopalians) be included into the Body of Christ&lt;/SPAN&gt;.&lt;SPAN style=&quot;COLOR: black&quot;&gt;The author explicates the concept of vocation, the call to serve God in His &lt;/SPAN&gt;church. He shares his personal experience.&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;Very inspiring!&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;A must read for those contemplating the ordained ministry.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

In addition, the book will be useful to those researching the history of the ordination of black Episcopalians and the birth of the black Episcopal congregation in the United States. It is a wonderful resource for those considering church construction. Finally, the author theologizes the building and provides a helpful manual for every worshiper whom the author (in&lt;I style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal&quot;&gt; reference to 1&lt;SUP&gt;st&lt;/SUP&gt; Peter&lt;/I&gt;) describes as living stones built upon the foundation of Jesus Christ, The chief Corner Stone.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />
