  <title>Walking the Ghosts: A Voices through Time Novella - Kari Kilgore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Amy Johnstone never imagined herself as a homeowner. Yet she finds herself with a set of keys in her hand. Outside a family house abandoned for the last thirty years.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And no earthly idea what to do next.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Decades away leave Amy uneasy in the woods outside Bountyfield, Virginia, unsure of friend or foe.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unsure if strange things around her come from paranoia or from an eerie, frightening reality.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Can Amy put her family ghosts to rest in time to save her own sanity?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An excerpt from Walking the Ghosts:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ghosts mark the passage of time in their own way.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s all in pretty good shape down here,&amp;rdquo; Amy said. &amp;ldquo;Maybe that luck will hold with the rest of the house.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Missy glanced back over her shoulder, eyes narrowed a bit but not giving a thing away. She led the way up the stairs and through the open trapdoor and into the darkness above.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When Amy stepped up onto the dark hardwood floor, she scowled at a curving set of deep gouges in the wide boards. She started to stay something to Missy, but stopped cold at the look on her face.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Missy&amp;rsquo;s full lips were compressed, and her eyebrows drawn down toward her dark blue eyes. She didn&amp;rsquo;t look angry, though, like Amy had just been.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Missy looked afraid.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What did&amp;ndash;&amp;rdquo; Amy started, then her gaze followed Missy&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She breathed in a sharp gasp of the thick, musty air.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Gouges weren&amp;rsquo;t the only thing marking the floor." />
