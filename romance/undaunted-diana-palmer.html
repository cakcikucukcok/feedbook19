  <title>Undaunted - Diana Palmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;h2&gt;The only man she wants is the one who will never forgive her!&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Falling in love with her boss&#39;s handsome millionaire neighbour was easy for Emma Copeland. Despite the vast differences between them, and a past that&#39;s left Connor Sinclair reclusive and wary, Emma gambles her heart on a desire that rocks them both. But there&#39;s something Connor doesn&#39;t know: Emma is responsible for an accident that changed his life forever.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Connor lives by rules intended to protect both him and his vast wealth. Emma&#39;s sweet innocence is the only thing that&#39;s ever broken through his reserve, but now the truth shatters his trust. By the time he realises how much he stands to lose if he loses Emma, it might take a miracle to win her back. But it&#39;s a challenge he has to face for the woman and the family he needs more than his next breath…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;This emotional, compelling story was inspired by a Diana Palmer classic tale.&lt;/em&gt;
