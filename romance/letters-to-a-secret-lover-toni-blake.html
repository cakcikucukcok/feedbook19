But then she got dumped&amp;#8212;wearing nothing but a &quot;Kiss the Cook&quot; apron&amp;#8212;and desperate to escape, she retreats to a tiny Montana town to reclaim a family treasure. She never dreamed anyone would try to stop her&amp;#8212;or that he&#39;d be sexy as sin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too bad she finds such a hot one . . . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rob Colter isn&#39;t into relationships&amp;#8212;but Lindsey sees Rob as the perfect guy to help her &quot;get back on the horse.&quot; The sex horse, that is. Unfortunately, he comes complete with a mysterious past, which gets even more mysterious when she finds his passionate letters to another woman&amp;#8212;whose name happens to be tattooed on his chest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And too bad he has so many secrets . . . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Rob&#39;s dangerous past is about to catch up with them both. And if that&#39;s not horrible enough, Lindsey is falling for him&amp;#8212;hard. For a girl who usually has all the answers, Lindsey is up to her neck in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;" />
