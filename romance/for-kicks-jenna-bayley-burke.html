  <title>For Kicks - Jenna Bayley-Burke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Breeze Cohen knows there&#39;s something missing from her life, but her career doesn&#39;t leave time for anything but retail business strategy. She has to prove herself by making sure the product launch for her company&#39;s cornerstone client, Nitrous, is a success. No way is she is she about to let live-for-the-moment Logan Chandler tarnish her professional reputation. Even if the former athlete is now Nitrous&#39;s poster boy and makes her heart pound like she&#39;s run a marathon. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After surviving a near-fatal accident, Logan doesn&#39;t want to waste a minute of life. It&#39;s meant to be lived, ravished, enjoyed--and there&#39;s no one he&#39;d like to ravish more than Breeze. There&#39;s a fiery desire beneath her icy facade. He can feel it every time they touch. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Logan&#39;s ready to take her for a run on the wild side--but he&#39;ll have to catch her.&lt;/p&gt;" />
