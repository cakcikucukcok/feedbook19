  <title>Montana Daddy (Mills &amp; Boon American Romance) - CHARLOTTE MACLAY</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Dr. Rory &quot;Swift Eagle&quot; Oakes could track, tame and treat the orneriest of beasts. But his five-foot-five freckle-faced first love Kristi Kerrigan had inexplicably disappeared from his life six years before, only to return to Grass Valley, Montana, with a new love: a dark-eyed, bronze-skinned little boy the spitting image of his daddy.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Rory couldn&#39;t deny the passion that blazed anew between him and the mother of his child. Nor could he deny the pain of being deprived of the miracle of his baby&#39;s first breath, and the five years of &quot;firsts&quot; that followed. But Kristi and their boy were within reach now, and this time Rory would stop at nothing to ensure these family ties lasted forever….&lt;/p&gt;
