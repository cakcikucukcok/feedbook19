But the house Becca picked for her midnight swim just changed owners. And her harmless escapade has landed her at the mercy of a brutal, terrifying organization who&#39;ll make sure she doesn&#39;t live to tell a soul. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can Cost You&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most gorgeous woman Nick Ward has ever laid eyes on is also the worst luck he&#39;s ever had. Becca&#39;s presence at this top-secret meeting place won&#39;t just destroy the undercover operation he&#39;s been working on, it&#39;s liable to get them both killed.
