  <title>How to Lose a Lord in 10 Days or Less - Elizabeth Michels</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;I want to know you, to understand anything at all about you, because you are the most maddening lady I have ever encountered.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He&#39;s the perfect gentleman...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;After years hidden away from the mockery of the Ton, proud Andrew Clifton, Lord Amberstall, is finally ready to face Society again. But when his horse is injured on the road to London, Andrew finds himself literally thrown at the feet of the beautiful, infuriating, and undeniably eccentric Katie Moore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;...she&#39;s anything but a lady.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; Katie always preferred the stables to society, so when she was badly injured in a riding accident, she was more than happy to retreat to the countryside and give up the marriage mart for good. She never expected an infuriatingly proper lord to come tumbling into her life-and she certainly never expected to find herself wondering what it would be like to rejoin the world at his side. They couldn&#39;t be more different, and soon Andrew and Katie find themselves at odds about everything but the growing passion between them...and a keen awareness of a threat that may end their unconventional romance before it has even begun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;I want to know you, to understand anything at all about you, because you are the most maddening lady I have ever encountered.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He&#39;s the perfect gentleman...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;After years hidden away from the mockery of the Ton, proud Andrew Clifton, Lord Amberstall, is finally ready to face Society again.
