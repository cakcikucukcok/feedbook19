  <title>Shattered Bonds: Book Seven of Wicked Play - Lynda Aicher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;em&gt;Will the doors of The Den close forever?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;When the lives and friendships of The Den owners are thrown into chaos, Noah Bakker steps in to deal with the fallout. He hasn&amp;#39;t had a sub or participated in a Scene since tragedy changed his life four years ago. But as an investor in the exclusive BDSM club, he can&amp;#39;t walk away from the lifestyle completely. As he works to keep the club running, he finds himself drawn to Liv Delcour, the seemingly naïve sister of one of the other owners.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Liv didn&amp;#39;t know about the naughty things her friends were up to behind closed doors, but when their secrets become headline news, she&amp;#39;s more curious than shocked. As she works with Noah to keep the media at bay, she finds that his dominant strength is more than a little arousing. Soon they&amp;#39;re exploring their mutual desires in the most wicked ways.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Liv isn&amp;#39;t sure if she can completely submit to Noah the way she thinks he wants her to&amp;#151;and Noah isn&amp;#39;t sure he can withstand the pain of falling in love&amp;#133;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;em&gt;New to the Den? Start at the beginning with&lt;/em&gt; Bonds of Trust.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;106,000 words" />
