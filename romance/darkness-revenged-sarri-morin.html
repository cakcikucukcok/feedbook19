  <title>Darkness Revenged - Sarri Morin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Marcia Winters always thought she understood the man she hopes will one day be her husband. She has nearly lost him once and does not want it to happen again. Despite dropping everything to have a life with him, she is still waiting for him to commit. But that is not her only challenge. Now an old enemy has returned and is taking over her nights. Even worse yet, Marcia has a foreboding feeling that something very bad is about to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donovan OHara is a retired cop who moved to Ireland to protect his friends and his lover, Marcia. While he is embroiled in an internal struggle as to whether he can be the man Marcia desires, he is attacked by a giant beast. After Donovan realizes that someone from their past is hunting them again, he must rely on help to destroy their enemies. But as he is about to discover, one vampire with the strength of an ancient is prepared to stop at nothing to attain vengeance. Now only time will tell if Marcia can forgive the past and whether Donovon can live with his choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this continuing supernatural tale, a young woman and her immortal lover must battle an evil presence seeking justice while attempting to move forward in their relationship.&lt;/p&gt;" />
