  <title>The Wrong Hostage - Elizabeth Lowell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The latest masterwork from one of the leading writers of suspense . . . &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Elizabeth Lowell returns with a chilling tale of the law gone wrong and a kidnapping that threatens more than one life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wrong Hostage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;p&gt;Orphaned at thirteen, Grace Silva clawed her way out of poverty and violence to become one of the most respected judges on the federal bench. Grace believes in the rule of law -- lives it, breathes it. She has always been buttoned up and buttoned down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except once. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joe Faroe has learned that laws are made by politicians, and politicians are all too human. He believes in the innocents, the ones getting ground up by governments that are too polarized or too corrupt to protect their own citizens. He&#39;s been through the political meat grinder himself. It cost him his career, his freedom, and the woman who still haunts him. Since then Faroe has worked outside the rules and politics of government as a kidnap specialist for St. Kilda Consulting, a Manhattan-based global business that concentrates on the shadow world where governments can&#39;t go. He is good at his work -- intelligent, confident, ruthless. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until a friend dies trying to kill him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Faroe is out of the business. Retired. He&#39;s through trying to save a world that doesn&#39;t want to be saved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Grace comes to him, past and present collide, and Faroe finds himself sucked back into the shadows, tracking a violent killer who holds the life of Grace&#39;s son in his bloody hands. &lt;/p&gt;" />
