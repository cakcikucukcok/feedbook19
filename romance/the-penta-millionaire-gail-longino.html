  <title>The Penta Millionaire - Gail Longino</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Baby did not want to go with Whip, but she was afraid to refuse. She had borne the brunt of his temper, and she knew he just as soon hit her as look at her. Oh, well. OK. I guess I can, she said. She hoped Cecil would take up for her and send Whip off on his own. That didnt happen. She decided she would buy a blow pop at the Quik Stop when they got to Main Street.
	Whip spit in the yard as they left it; this time he had a real gun with him.
	Baby was quiet all the way to town. She said, Whatcha gonna do now?					
	What difference does it make? You wouldnt understand if I told ya. You not only the dumbest girl in town, you the ugliest too.
	Baby was used to abuse; she thought it was normal. She knew she could not argue with Whip or she would get even worse treatment. So why did you want me to go along with ya tonight?
	Im teaching ya how to stand up for yaself. No one else will. Youre hopeless! Whip sneered. When they got to the Quik Stop, she went in and bought her sucker. He got a beer and drank it while they walked toward Ms. Greys house. It was dark, and when they got there, they eased around to the back of the house. No lights were on, and no cars were parked on the street.
	This is gonna be easy. Well wait and see when she comes home, and then when she goes inside, well get her. Whip knew Thursday night she always went out around seven and came home around nine thirty.
	How we gonna do that? We cant just go in and get her, Baby said.
	Whip pulled out the key from his pocket. Jus like this, he said.
	Baby didnt want to harm Ms. Grey. No, I wont help you, she said and ran as fast as she could around the corner of the house.
	He hunkered down behind the bushes and sipped on his beer." />
