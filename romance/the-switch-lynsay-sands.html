  <title>The Switch - Lynsay Sands</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When they first met Lord Jeremy William Radcliffe, Charlie and her twin sister, Elizabeth were escaping from their uncle-taking turns acting the young gentleman to avoid detection. But Charlie couldn&amp;#8217;t help falling head over heels-and out of a window-for the handsome lord. Of course, that was only the beginning; Lord Radcliffe insisted on showing &amp;#8220;him&amp;#8221; and her lovely sister to London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how could he do that? With every touch, Radcliffe seemed unknowingly to incite indecent desires in Charlie, and his fraternal intent was certain to land her in a fine mess. Though it was a great game to play a boy, there was more fun in being female. And after one brush of his fiery lips when her guise was gone, Charlie swore to be nothing but his fiery woman forevermore. &lt;/p&gt;" />
