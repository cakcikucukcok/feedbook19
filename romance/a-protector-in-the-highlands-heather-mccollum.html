  <title>A Protector in the Highlands - Heather McCollum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;1684, Scottish Highlands&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s become abundantly clear to Scarlet Worthington that England no longer can offer her anything good. With few other options, she flees to the wilds of Scotland to help her sister, who has created a place where women learn to protect themselves. There is something special about the Highlands. It could be the lush rolling hills, the clean air, the feeling of doing something good... or maybe it&#39;s the fierce Campbell warrior she&#39;s recruited to help. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aiden Campbell has spent months recovering from burns he sustained in a fire set by English soldiers. Finally, he&#39;s healed enough to take temporary command of his clan. Between the fire and his own ghosts, there is no love lost between him and the English. So why does he say yes when the new Englishwoman in town asks for his help? And why does she have the power to distract him so much? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Scarlet&#39;s past stalks her all the way to Scotland, her nightmares become real and the things Aiden has taught her are put to the test. And as Aiden fights the heat of passion that grows between them, a different kind of wildfire threatens everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each book in The Campbells series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* The Scottish Rogue&lt;br&gt;* The Savage Highlander&lt;br&gt;* The Wicked Viscount&lt;br&gt;* The Highland Outlaw&lt;/p&gt;" />
