          &lt;strong&gt;THE BOY WHO GOT AWAY WAS ALL MAN NOW&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Once Melissa Richardson had been the most popular girl in school and Charles Avery had been the shy brain with a hopeless crush. Now Melissa was alone, pregnant and in need of a job–and her new employer was Charles Avery!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Melissa&#39;s shock at seeing Charles again was matched only by her mortification at the attraction he roused in her. Her former admirer had grown into a handsome, successful hunk–and a widowed single dad with three adorable children in need of a nanny. Hiding her feelings for her boss as well as the embarrassing truth about her situation seemed a wise professional move. But could she resist Charles&#39;s charm &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; three disarming kids who didn&#39;t want a nanny, but a mommy?&lt;/p&gt;
