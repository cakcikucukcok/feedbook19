          &lt;strong&gt;HE HAD MARRIED FOR CONVENIENCE…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Widower Neil Griffen thought he&#39;d never marry again. But when lovely Cara LaCroix told him her plan to find herself a temporary husband to fulfill her beloved grandmother&#39;s dearest wish, Neil knew he&#39;d trust her to no one else. Not only was she his best employee, Cara was his best friend–what difference could a few months of pretend marital bliss make?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;SHE HAD MARRIED FOR LOVE…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cara had loved her handsome boss forever, and marrying Neil in name only would be sweet torment. Neil treated her as a kid sister–but behind the wall of his carefully guarded emotions, she sensed something more. Suddenly Cara knew she&#39;d risk their friendship, on the chance that something might be love….&lt;/p&gt;
