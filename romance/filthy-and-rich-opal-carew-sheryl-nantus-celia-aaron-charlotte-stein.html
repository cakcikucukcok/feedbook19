  <title>Filthy and Rich - Opal Carew, Sheryl Nantus, Celia Aaron, Charlotte Stein...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sensually dirty and filthy rich, these five smoking hot billionaire ménage stories will leave you breathless. Includes stories by New York Times bestselling author Opal Carew, Sheryl Nantus, Celia Aaron, Charlotte Stein, and Calista Fox.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Drilled&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;, Opal Carew&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;When construction worker Danni goes to the latest job site over the weekend to redo some of her crew&#39;s sloppy work, she doesn&#39;t expect the billionaire owners of the company, Blake and Evan, to be working overtime as well. What starts out as a flirty invitation to cool down with a swim turns hotter than Danni could&#39;ve ever imagined. Soon Danni finds herself longing for more than a casual fling with her billionaires, but how could they ever want more with a simple construction worker? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Three&#39;s Temptation, &lt;/i&gt;Sheryl Nantus&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A woman who was torn between her two loves at college graduation--the tattooed bad boy and the star athlete--five years later regrets not choosing them both. When she and the now rival tech billionaires attend the same charity gala, old jealousies and passions return for a night they&#39;ll never forget...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Legally Screwed, &lt;/i&gt;Celia Aaron&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;When a lawyer goes into a mundane appointment for estate planning, she has no idea she&#39;s about to meet two super hot best friends who do everything--everything--together. And that what they want more than anything is to have her in their bed, over and over again...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Not Safe for Work, &lt;/i&gt;Charlotte Stein&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;Employees must maintain clear boundaries between personal and professional relationships and conduct themselves in a manner appropriate to the office...&quot;&lt;/i&gt; When Hartford brings in Abel Hernandez as the new CEO for his company Hartford Industries, he&#39;s prepared for Abel to shake things up...but not quite like this and certainly not with his personal assistant Amy, the one woman he&#39;s always wanted but never taken. He sees them breaking all of his precious rules, and he intends to reprimand them for it. The only problem is, it isn&#39;t anger he feels towards his two most trusted employees...it&#39;s possession. It&#39;s desire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Possession, &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Calista Fox&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sylvia Carter&#39;s hot hookup with sexy Seth Lofton--billionaire owner of the Aspen-esque Bliss Mountain Ski Resort in Northern California--is only meant to be a one-night stand. But their explosive chemistry has them continually tangled up in each other. And when Seth&#39;s best friend, hotel magnate Noah Donovan, comes to town, he and Sylvia spark just as passionately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seth is considering selling the megaresort just as Noah plans to build a luxury hotel with an award-winning spa, which threatens Sylvia&#39;s new day spa. Their personal agendas create plenty of friction--but a fiery love triangle is a temptation none of them can resist. The emotional intensity is just as strong as the sexual burn, though they&#39;re still at a crossroads with their business dilemmas--until Seth and Noah make a pact to give the woman they&#39;re falling in love with everything her heart desires... But can Sylvia afford to take the bait?&lt;/p&gt;" />
