  <title>The Promise (Thunder Point, Book 5) - Robyn Carr</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Thunder Point series&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Promise - Book 5&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;#1 New York Times bestselling author Robyn Carr returns to Thunder Point with an uplifting story about overcoming loss and finding unexpected love.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Scott Grant has a bustling family practice in the small Oregon community of Thunder Point. The town and its people have embraced the widowed doctor and father of two, his children are thriving, and Scott knows it&#39;s time to move on from his loss. But as the town&#39;s only doctor, the dating scene is awkward. That is, until a stunning physician&#39;s assistant applies for a job at his clinic.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Peyton Lacoumette considers herself entirely out of the dating scene. She&#39;s already been burned by a man with kids, and she&#39;s come to Thunder Point determined not to repeat past mistakes. When Scott offers her a job, at a much lower salary than she&#39;s used to, Peyton is surprisingly eager to accept… at least for now. She&#39;s willing to stay for a three-month trial period while she explores other options.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Scott and Peyton know the arrangement is temporary - it isn&#39;t enough time to build a real relationship, never mind anything with lasting commitment. But love can blossom faster than you think when the timing is right, and this short visit just might hold the promise of forever.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Praise for Robyn Carr&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; ‘A touch of danger and suspense make the latest in Carr&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Thunder Point&lt;/em&gt; series a powerful read.’ –&lt;em&gt;RT Book Reviews&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;em&gt;The Hero&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;‘With her trademark mixture of humor, realistic conflict, and razor-sharp insights, Carr brings &lt;em&gt;Thunder Point&lt;/em&gt; to vivid life.’ –&lt;em&gt;Library Journal&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;em&gt;The Newcomer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;‘No one can do small-town life like Carr.&#39; –&lt;em&gt;RT Book Reviews&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;em&gt;The Wanderer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;‘Strong conflict, humor and well-written characters are Carr&#39;s calling cards, and they&#39;re all present here… You won&#39;t want to put this one down.’ –&lt;em&gt;RT Book Reviews&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Angel&#39;s Peak&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;‘This story has everything: a courageous, outspoken heroine, a to-die-for hero and a plot that will touch readers&#39; hearts on several different levels. Truly excellent.’ –&lt;em&gt;RT Book Reviews&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Forbidden Falls&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;‘An intensely satisfying read. By turns humorous and gut-wrenchingly emotional, it won&#39;t soon be forgotten.’ –&lt;em&gt;RT Book Reviews&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Paradise Valley&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;‘Carr has hit her stride with this captivating series.’ –&lt;em&gt;Library Journal&lt;/em&gt; on the &lt;em&gt;Virgin River&lt;/em&gt; series&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;‘The &lt;em&gt;Virgin River&lt;/em&gt; books are so compelling - I connected instantly with the characters and just wanted more and more and more.’ –#1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author &lt;strong&gt;Debbie Macomber&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
