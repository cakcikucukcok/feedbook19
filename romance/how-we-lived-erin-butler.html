      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;A new adult novel from Entangled&#39;s Embrace imprint...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The secrets he&#39;s keeping from that night could destroy everything again...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nineteen-year-old Kelsey Larkin&#39;s parents uninvited her to her brother&#39;s funeral. She just wanted to wear jeans and a T-shirt-the clothes Kyle would&#39;ve wanted her in-not wrap herself up in death. So she watched the funeral from afar, like an outsider. Which is just how she feels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chase came, though, just like she knew he would. Until a few months ago, the three of them had been best friends, and then Chase made a mistake that shattered both families. But when Kelsey looks at him, she doesn&#39;t see her brother&#39;s killer. She sees the boy next door who&#39;s always taken care of her. She sees &lt;i&gt;home&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Chase tells her his feelings run deeper than friendship, she can&#39;t help but get lost in him. In Chase, she finally has the closure she&#39;s been unable to find anywhere else. But the boy she&#39;s falling in love with is still hiding secrets about the night Kyle died. Secrets that could destroy everything they have...again.&lt;/p&gt;" />
