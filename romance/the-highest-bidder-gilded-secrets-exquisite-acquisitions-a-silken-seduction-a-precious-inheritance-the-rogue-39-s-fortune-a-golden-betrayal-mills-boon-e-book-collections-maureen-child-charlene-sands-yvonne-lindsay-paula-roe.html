        &lt;p&gt;The six books of the Modern romance series collected together.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;THE HIGHEST BIDDER - Where everything’s for sale, true love is priceless…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;GILDED SECRETS by Maureen Child&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Defending his legacy…at any cost. When scandal threatens the luxury auction house that bears his family’s name, Vance Waverly suspects the media feeding frenzy is an inside job. Could his gorgeous assistant, Charlotte Potter, be plotting his downfall? There’s one way to find out: seduce the truth out of her! Charlie is between a rock and a hard place. She can reveal Waverly’s secrets to her unidentified blackmailer or lose custody of her child. Whatever she does, she’ll lose the career she loves. But losing the man she’s come to love – her big, bad boss – could put her over the edge…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;EXQUISITE ACQUISITIONS Charlene Sands&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sold to the sexy cowboy! For Macy Tarlington, the only good part of seeing her legendary mother’s possessions sold at auction is ogling Carter McCay, the tall Texan who buys the famous diamond ring. Even better is seeing him again, when he rescues her from the paparazzi like a white knight in a Stetson. Carter whisks her to safety at his ranch, hiding her identity by day and lusting after her by night. Yes, he’s sworn off love. But with this Hollywood runaway starring in his every fantasy Carter might find Macy too much temptation – even for a hard-hearted cowboy.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A SILKEN SEDUCTION Yvonne Lindsay&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The fine art of temptation. London socialite Avery Cullen refuses to sell her late father’s art collection. But bold, brash Marcus Price will try everything to get her to reconsider. He even launches an all-out sexual siege on the lonely heiress. Securing the collection would be a coup for his auction house, but for Marcus it will settle a lifelong score. He’s managed to keep his true motives hidden along with his family’s skeletons…and now he’s so close he can taste success in Avery’s kiss. But after their torrid night of passion is Marcus prepared for the outcome?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A PRECIOUS INHERITANCE Paula Roe&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;He won the auction… Vanessa Partridge has a good reason for wanting the manuscript offered at auction – it is her twins’ legacy. But she doesn’t count on the winning bidder, financial guru Chase Harrington, showing up on her doorstep.Now he wants the woman… Chase has a new obsession – Vanessa. There’s more to the former socialite-turned-working-single-mum than meets the eye…and he’s going to find it. He’s got secrets of his own – secrets threatened by the sexy Vanessa. More than anything Chase wants to give in to their sizzling attraction…but can he afford to play with fire?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;THE ROGUE’S FORTUNE Cat Schield&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Minerva tries to steer clear of legendary adventurer Roark Black and focus on her career. But the rakish treasure hunter is the only one who can help her, if she’ll do him one tiny favor…. To save his beloved auction house and his own reputation from ruin, Roark needs to settle down…fast! After a six-month &quot;engagement,&quot; he and Elizabeth can go their separate ways. But Roark knows priceless objects, and Elizabeth is the real deal. Now he intends to keep her….by any means necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A GOLDEN BETRAYAL Barbara Dunlop&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In his kingdom, Crown Prince Raif Khouri commands, and women obey…until he meets headstrong American Ann Richardson. To get back the priceless statue he’s convinced she stole, Raif kidnaps her!Held captive by the sexy prince and mired in scandal at her auction house, Ann has her hands full. How can she convince Raif she&#39;s innocent…and convince her traitorous body to resist his sultry kisses? But after one night with the woman his duty will never let him have, it&#39;s Raif who realises that the highest price to pay might just be his heart…&lt;/p&gt;
