      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;It seems as if Tyler Balfour&#39;s mother was the only woman in town his father didn&#39;t marry. So he&#39;s as surprised as anyone when he discovers Anderson left him a third of everything he owned.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tyler doesn&#39;t plan on sticking around. After all, the good people of Heyday already believe he&#39;s responsible for ruining their town. Not that he cares what they think. He was only doing his job.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now that he&#39;s back in Heyday, he&#39;s starting to realize his job just might be finding out what Mallory Rackham–one of the town&#39;s favorite daughters–is so desperately trying to hide.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;Three brothers with different mothers. Brought together by their father&#39;s last act. The town of Heyday, Virginia, will never be the same–and neither will they.&lt;/em&gt;
