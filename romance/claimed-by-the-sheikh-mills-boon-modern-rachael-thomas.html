          &lt;strong&gt;Banished!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Princess Amber’s arranged marriage to Prince Kazim Al-Amed of Barazbin was a dream come true – for her, at least! But then their wedding night went spectacularly wrong, and a furious Kazim banished Amber from his kingdom and his life…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Hunted!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now, with his country in turmoil Kazim must prove his ability to rule and provide an heir for his people. But to do so he’ll need to track down his princess.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Claimed!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Amber has always threatened Kazim’s tightly held control. Yet if he is to save his nation – and his marriage – he must finally make the ultimate claim…on his wife!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Praise for Rachael Thomas&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Claimed by the Sheikh &lt;em&gt;4* RT Book Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thomas’s tale is full of secrets, lies and veiled passion. Her visual depiction of the exotic, opulent desert locales and the emotionally heartrending ending is excellent.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Deal Before the Altar &lt;em&gt;4* RT Book Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thomas’ high-society romance is a terrific debut. Her vulnerable-beneath-the-bravado heroine and lonely, aloof hero make multiple convincing miscalculations on their obstacle-laden road to love — and their heat between the sheets blazes.&lt;/p&gt;
