  <title>My Father&#39;s Children: A Victorian Tale of Incest - Ona Dare</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
England, 1884 - After my mother&amp;#39;s funeral, I knew I was no longer safe. I was of very little value to my father, at least that I knew of. I couldn&amp;#39;t interpret the looks he shot my way, and wondered why he hated me so. Little did I know it wasn&amp;#39;t hatred he felt. But where could I run? Who could I tell? No one is going to go keep a Duke from doing exactly as he pleased.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Father? You needed to see me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I should thrash you for making me wait! Sit down. We have much to discuss.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Of course, Father.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She&amp;rsquo;s shaking like a leaf in a ferocious wind. Good. Her fear makes my cock grow until I know she can see it. I stand before her, leaning on my desk and let her look her fill.&lt;br /&gt;
Pouring two glasses of brandy, I hand one to her and say, &amp;ldquo;Drink. Drink it all. It will sustain you for what is to come.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her eyes are wide with terror now and she&amp;rsquo;s just where I want her. Damn, but I wish she had some gumption. I wish she was more apt to defy me. Then the punishment would be especially delicious. But she is a weakling, just like her mother, so I will have to make do.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;There is a room beneath the Manor where I will require your presence whenever I demand it. It is equipped with many things I feel will delight you&amp;hellip;once your fear and pain have subsided. Yes, I can see that such a thought leaves you breathless with more than a little anxiety&amp;hellip;and well it should.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Gone are the days your Mother will protect you from me. She is gone and there is no one left who cares to protect you. And it is foolish on your part to expect the servants will much care about whatever I have planned for you. It is me, after all, who pays their salary. It is me who they will serve, not your fears. Drink the rest of your brandy, my dear. I have waited long enough to have what I desire.&amp;rdquo;" />
