        &lt;p&gt;Dear Uncle Eli,&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t think Daddy is getting me what I really want for Christmas–a mommy. He&#39;s been sad since Mommy died, and I want him to be happy again. And ever since Leah, my new nanny, came to stay, he&#39;s been smiling more. She&#39;s really nice. She makes cookies with me and takes me to church. I think Leah is perfect for us. I told him he should marry her, but he&#39;s busy with his carpentering stuff. Maybe he&#39;ll listen to you? Tell him my Christmas wish is to have Leah with us, ALWAYS.&lt;/p&gt;
