  <title>The Harbor of His Arms (Mills &amp; Boon Love Inspired) (Safe Harbor, Book 1) - Lynn Bulock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Ever since Holly Douglas&#39; s husband had been killed, she and her twin sons had lived on borrowed time. Now her husband&#39; s killer was back on the streets– and investigator Alex Wilkins was the only man she could count on to protect her.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Accustomed to burning the candle at both ends, Holly soon found her burden eased by Alex. But as she began to let him into her life– and her heart– his piercing eyes soon saw more than she intended as he unmasked her most closely guarded secret. A secret at odds with her strong faith. And Holly was praying to God for the strength to trust in the newfound love she&#39; d found in the harbor of Alex&#39; s embrace.&lt;/p&gt;
