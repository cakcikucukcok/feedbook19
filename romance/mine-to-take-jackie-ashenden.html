      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;First in the Nine Circles series by Jackie Ashenden featuring billionaire friends bound together by power, secrets, need...and the love they will find and stop at nothing to keep.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Passion always comes at a price.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabriel Woolf is unstoppable. A ruthless businessman, he has perfected the art of revenge. Ever since his mother&#39;s death, Gabriel has harbored only one wish: To take down the man who ruined their lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But all bets are off when he meets his father&#39;s step daughter, Honor St. James. Beautiful and innocent, she is everything Gabriel never knew he wanted--and now there&#39;s no turning back...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Is her desire worth the risk?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honor wasn&#39;t born yesterday. She knows that Gabriel is a wolf in sheep&#39;s clothing, willing to cross any line to get what he wants...herself included. But Gabriel&#39;s passion for Honor--in spite of her connection to the man he hates the most--cannot be denied...and the feeling is utterly mutual. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can Gabriel be trusted? The only thing she knows for sure is how he makes her feel. And she can&#39;t keep herself from coming back to him, over and over again...in &lt;i&gt;Mine to Take.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t miss the other books in this series:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Book #2: Make You Mine&lt;br&gt;Book #3: You Are Mine&lt;br&gt;Book #4: Kidnapped by the Billionaire&lt;br&gt;Book #5: In Bed with the Billionaire&lt;/p&gt;" />
