  <title>A King&#39;s Daughter - Audra Lilly Griffeth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A Birthmark, A Princess, A Special Destiny in Romantic Novel, A King&#39;s Daughter &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FORT WORTH, Texas- A red birthmark on the face of a newborn baby daughter turns its mother, a Queen into a suspicious, if not superstitious, woman. Queen Charlotte, wife to King Edward, gives birth to her child, but upon knowing that the mark will not go away immediately loses faith in everything and turns away from A King&#39;s daughter. Audra Lilly Griffeth&#39;s exciting story is potent with the romance attendant on royalty and how its members fare when a twist of fate condemns them or one of their members to a commoner&#39;s fate but is destined to come back to the fold. And thus, the story unfolds... Born Princess Eva Kathleen Wellington, Eva is loved by the Queen&#39;s servant Lady Margaret, when her mother continues with her passionate denial of her daughter&#39;s defect. Although it may have turned out worse, Princess Eva&#39;s story is proof of a more romantic, benign fate that is perhaps the antithesis to the Queen&#39;s unfounded fears of having a &quot;defective&quot; and cursed infant. In any case, a cosmetic cure could have been eventually found except that there was no hiding the Queen&#39;s strange behavior towards her newborn for too long. Sad and concerned for the Princesses&#39; future, Lady Margaret arranged a fake kidnapping in a nearby forest when King and Queen are off on a state to visit another kingdom. When news of &quot;kidnapping&quot; reaches them two days after the fact, the Queen is unaffected while the King is in depair and does not fully recover even after the birth of two sons and another daughter to continue his line. Meanwhile, Eva and Lady Margaret, as Evanlynn and Mary Engleton (mother and daughter), prosper as nest they could in Margaret&#39;s grandparent&#39;s dairy farm. Fate takes another surprising turn when Sir Daniel, a trusted officer of the King, befriends Margaret and unwittingly influences her to reveal their existence to the King. The King is overjoyed and Evanlynn shows the truth of her genetic make-up by naturally adapting to a set of strange, new circumstances. With a flair for a well-turned out plot which generates its own set of unique circumstances, Griffeth then sets in motion a whirlwind of love, repentance, acceptance and a more special destiny for the entire kingdom that would not have been possible had it not lost a Princess to the vagaries of natural physical form.&lt;/p&gt;" />
