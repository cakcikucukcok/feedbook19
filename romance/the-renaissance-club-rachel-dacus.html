  <title>The Renaissance Club - Rachel Dacus</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;May Gold, college adjunct, often dreams about the subject of her master&amp;rsquo;s thesis - Gianlorenzo Bernini. In her fantasies she&amp;rsquo;s in his arms, the wildly adored partner of the man who invented the Baroque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in reality, May has just landed in Rome with her teaching colleagues and older boyfriend who is paying her way. She yearns to unleash her passion and creative spirit, and when the floor under the gilded dome of St Peter&amp;rsquo;s basilica rocks under her feet, she gets her chance. Walking through the veil that appears, she finds herself in the year 1624, staring straight into Bernini&amp;rsquo;s eyes. Their immediate and powerful attraction grows throughout May&amp;rsquo;s tour of Italy. And as she continues to meet her ethereal partner, even for brief snatches of time, her creativity and confidence blossom. All the doorways to happiness seem blocked for May-all except the shimmering doorway to Bernini&amp;rsquo;s world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May has to choose: stay in her safe but stagnant existence, or take a risk. Will May&amp;rsquo;s adventure in time ruin her life or lead to a magical new one?&lt;/p&gt;" />
