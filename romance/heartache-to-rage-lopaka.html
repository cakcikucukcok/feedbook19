  <title>Heartache to Rage - Lopaka</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A very impressionable boy is permanently traumatized by the horror of the Holocaust. He is consumed by his hatred of his father and every other Nazi in the world. His sole purpose in life is to exterminate every Nazi who was implicated in the holocaust. His obsession grows to include every relative, even to the third generation.
Colonel Otto Richter is stationed in Marseilles as WW1 ends. As he is walking back to his post he hears moaning coming from a freight car on a side track. Inside the car is a young French soldier who has been wounded. Otto doesnt know the young soldier is the nephew of the captain of a ship tied at the dock in Marseilles.
Nor does he know there is a fortune on that freight car.
General Emil Richter (Ottos son) and Gunter Rawls know the German soldiers are pilfering everything they can get their hands on as WW2 is winding down. Emil and Gunter are not interested in pilfering food and cigarettes. Gunter knows the whereabouts of the art galleries in Europe that house the most famous paintings in the world. Now there is something worth pilfering.
Seasoned with romance and intrigue and sprinkled with indelicate sex, Heartache to Rage runs the gamut of emotions." />
