  <title>Alive at 5 - Linda Bond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;TV news reporter Samantha Steele is one panic attack away from losing her job. Future on the line and cameraman in tow, she follows her mentor on an exhilarating adventure vacation. When he dies while skydiving, her investigative instincts scream &quot;murdered,&quot; and lead her to gorgeous thrill-seeker Zack Hunter. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zack is an undercover police officer investigating his uncle&#39;s death through the same adventure vacation company. Samantha is a thorn in his side the moment they meet. Not only is she investigating the same case, but the emotionally wounded loner doesn&#39;t want another partner, especially one whose goal is to splash evidence all over the evening news. But Samantha&#39;s persistence is quite a turn-on, and Zack&#39;s overpowering desire makes it harder for him to push her away. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the killer turns his attention to Zack, Samantha might be the only one who can save him, forcing the anxiety-riddled correspondent to finally face her greatest fear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Investigators series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Alive at 5&lt;br&gt;* Cuba Undercover&lt;br&gt;* Flatline&lt;/p&gt;" />
