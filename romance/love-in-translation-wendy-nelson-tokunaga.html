  <title>Love in Translation - Wendy Nelson Tokunaga</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Stuck.  That&#39;s how 33-year-old aspiring singer Celeste Duncan feels, with her deadbeat boyfriend and static career. But then Celeste receives a puzzling phone call and a box full of mysterious family heirlooms which just might be the first real clue to the identity of the father she never knew. Impulsively, Celeste flies to Japan to search for a long-lost relative who could be able to explain. She stumbles head first into a weird, wonderful world where nothing is quite as it seems--a land with an inexplicable fascination with foreigners, karaoke boxes, and unbearably perky TV stars. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With little knowledge of Japanese, Celeste finds a friend in her English-speaking homestay brother, Takuya, and comes to depend on him for all variety of translation, travel and investigatory needs. As they cross the country following a trail after Celeste&#39;s family, she discovers she&#39;s developing &quot;more-than-sisterly&quot; feelings for him. But with a nosy homestay mom scheming to reunite Takuya with his old girlfriend, and her search growing dimmer, Celeste begins to wonder whether she&#39;s made a terrible mistake by coming to Japan. Can Celeste find her true self in this strange land, and discover that love can transcend culture?&lt;/p&gt;" />
