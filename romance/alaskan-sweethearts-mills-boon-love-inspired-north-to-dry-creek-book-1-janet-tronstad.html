        &lt;p&gt;A Match Made in Alaska&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hunter Jacobson wants no part of his grandfather&#39;s matchmaking. The lone cowboy is certain that&#39;s what the old man is doing when he trades part of their Montana ranch for Scarlett Murphy&#39;s claim to an old Alaska gold mine. Or is he running one of his legendary scams on the sweet single mom? A trip to Dry Creek, Alaska, reveals the truth–and brings Hunter and Scarlett face-to-face with a past family feud and a vulnerable present. But surprisingly it&#39;s the future that intrigues Hunter most…if he can get Scarlett to make him her groom.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NORTH TO DRY CREEK:&lt;/strong&gt; The road to Alaska is paved with love&lt;/p&gt;
