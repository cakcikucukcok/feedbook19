  <title>Playing Defense - Cate Cameron</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sixteen-year-old Claudia Waring has never kissed a boy. Never been popular. Never been to a hockey game. All that&#39;s about to change. Assigned to tutor Chris Winslow, a prank-loving, gorgeous hockey player, Claudia&#39;s perfectly planned life immediately veers off course. And she kind of likes it. But as fun as Chris is, she knows she&#39;ll never fit in his world. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After his latest prank lands him in hot water, Chris has to get serious about school or lose hockey. Not an easy thing for someone as carefree as the defenseman. The biggest problem, though, is how much he wants to help his cute, buttoned-up tutor loosen up a little. But while confidence has never been a problem for him, around Claudia, Chris is all nerves. Why would a girl as smart as her ever fall for a jock like him?&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Disclaimer: This Entangled Teen Crush book contains adult language, swoon-worthy kisses, and sexy hockey players. It may cause you to watch a hockey game...or ten.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Corrigan Falls Raiders series is a standalone, full-length story that can be enjoyed out of order.&lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Center Ice&lt;br&gt;Book #2 Playing Defense&lt;br&gt;Book #3 Winging It&lt;br&gt;Book #4 Breakaway&lt;/p&gt;" />
