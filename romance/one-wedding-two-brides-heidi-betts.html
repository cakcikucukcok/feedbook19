  <title>One Wedding, Two Brides - Heidi Betts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jilted bride Monica Blair can&#39;t believe it when she wakes up next to a blue-eyed, smooth-talking cowboy in the middle of nowhere and with a ring on her finger. It had sounded like a great plan at the time. Get married, get revenge, and get her money back. So why is she cleaning out stables and trying to keep her hands off the hot cowboy helping her? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryder Nash would have bet his best Stetson that you&#39;d never see him walk down the aisle. But when the city girl with pink-streaked hair and a frog tattoo hatches a plan to expose the conman who married his sister, no idea is too crazy. And even though Monica might be the worst rancher&#39;s wife he&#39;s ever seen, he can&#39;t stop thinking about the wedding night they never had.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What was supposed to be a temporary marriage for revenge is starting to feel a little too real...&lt;/p&gt;" />
