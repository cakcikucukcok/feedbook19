  <title>Regency Rumour: Never Trust a Rake / Reforming the Viscount (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Annie Burrows</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Never Trust a Rake&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Rumour has it that the Earl of Deben, the most notorious rake in London and in need of an heir, has set aside his penchant for married mistresses and turned his skilled hand to seducing innocents!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But if Lord Deben expects Henrietta Gibson to respond to the click of his fingers – he’s got another think coming. For she knows perfectly well why she should avoid gentlemen of his bad repute:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;1. One touch of his lips and he’ll ruin her for every other man.&lt;br /&gt;2. One glide of his skilful fingers to the neckline of her dress will leave her molten in his arms.&lt;br /&gt;3. And if even one in a thousand rumours is true, it’s enough to know she can never, ever, trust a rake….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Reforming the Viscount&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Viscount Rothersthorpe can’t tear his eyes from Lydia Morgan any more than he can calm the raging fury coursing through his veins. Is there no end to the irony? Come to town to find a wife only to be taunted by the past?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Furtive glances across the ballroom are not helping to ease Lydia’s state of shock – the man who once uttered a marriage proposal as one might remark upon the weather has returned. But when he stuns her with a second outrageous – but now wickedly delicious – proposal, it is clear that despite the rumours, the rake from her past has not reformed!&lt;/p&gt;
