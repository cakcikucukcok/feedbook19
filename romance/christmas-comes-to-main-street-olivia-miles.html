  <title>Christmas Comes to Main Street - Olivia Miles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Christmas at the Cottage&lt;/i&gt; comes the perfect holiday romance for &quot;readers seeking a peppermint-filled, cozy Christmas contemporary&quot; (&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Tis the worst season to be single, but Kara Hastings won&#39;t let a little Christmas funk spoil the festive season. Sure, running her own bakery is a little harder than she expected, but she can handle it. And she&#39;ll prove it to a certain infuriatingly handsome, bossy Big City guy. She may be sugar and spice, but she can kick his butt twice. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Nate Griffin is in Briar Creek only for the holidays, and he refuses to fall for the whole &quot;small town, candy cane-scented Christmas Wonderland&quot; thing. He&#39;s more interested in the fresh-faced cookie chef who always knows exactly how to get under his skin. So when Nate challenges Kara in the town&#39;s big holiday contest, it&#39;s not just the competition that starts to heat up. If he&#39;s not careful, Kara won&#39;t just melt his icy resolve against a small-town Christmas . . . she&#39;ll melt his heart too.&lt;br&gt;" />
