  <title>Take the Case - Pauli Payne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Eileen Stiner has messed up. Big time. In her job as a government techno-geek, she just happened to misinterpret a transmission and accidentally sent a field team to the wrong side of the world. Whoops.
To remedy the situation, her boss, Mr. Nelson, throws her into an Arizona desert and orders her to snatch a certain briefcase out of the hands of two sleazy criminals. But her skills at staking out arent quite up to snuff, so Mr. Nelson adds another agent into the mix: the incredibly sexy and incredibly irritating Chris Lando.
While Eileen is relieved to have a true professional on the job, she hates how Lando expects her to follow his commands like a well-trained seal. But what she hates more is the sizzling attraction she feels toward him, one he apparently shares. Even when theyre dodging bullets or embarking on high-speed car chases, neither can deny the sparks shooting between them.
But the situation takes a serious turn when they discover theyre up against a ruthless arms dealer who has plans to use a high-tech gadget to create world-wide chaos. Eileen and Lando must stop him at any costs, and this time, theres no room for mistakes." />
