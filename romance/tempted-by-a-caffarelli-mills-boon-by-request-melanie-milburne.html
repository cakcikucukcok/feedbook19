  <title>Tempted By A Caffarelli (Mills &amp; Boon By Request) - Melanie Milburne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Never Say No to a Caffarelli&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&quot;I play by the rules, but they&#39;re my rules.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Poppy Silverton is as untouched as the leafy English village where she runs a tearoom. But her home, her livelihood and her innocence are under threat….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Rafe Caffarelli is a mouthwatering specimen of Mediterranean manhood. He&#39;s a playboy billionaire and determined to buy Poppy&#39;s historic dower house.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Poppy will not give up the only thing that remains of her childhood and family. She&#39;ll fight Rafe–and her attraction to him–all the way. And be the first woman to say &quot;no&quot; to a Caffarelli!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Never Underestimate a Caffarelli&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Millionaire playboy Raoul Caffarelli has always lived life in the fast lane. But when an accident confines him to a wheelchair—and to the care of a woman whose beauty taunts him—he&#39;s consumed with rage and frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Used to difficult patients, physical therapist Lily Archer won&#39;t be cowed by Raoul&#39;s arrogance or distracted by his Adonis-like physique. Carrying her own scars from the past, Lily has vowed never to relinquish her power to a man again.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Both underestimate the power of the shared passion between them. Their physical scars may heal, but some wounds run much deeper….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Never Gamble with a Caffarelli&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Model and heiress Angelique Marchand is furious. Continental playboy Remy Caffarelli—devastatingly handsome and notoriously arrogant—has won her mother&#39;s ancestral home in a card game!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Angelique tracks him down in the Middle East to confront him and reclaim her birthright. But when she is found in his hotel room, the sworn enemies are forced to marry! And surprisingly, rather than annul the bond, Remy wants to exploit their marriage for business…and for pleasure!&lt;/p&gt;
