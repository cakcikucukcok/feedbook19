  <title>Found A Beautiful Girl Lost in an Ugly World - Brad Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What do you do when someone comes along in your life with a chance for love? Especially when you&amp;#39;ve never achieved a goal, always been alone, but have distractions to build the ego. Well, that&amp;#39;s a situation that comes to Willsie, a young man from Shen-Mont whose dream is to be Musician of the Universe,&amp;nbsp;a symbol of success and fame in the genres of music.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a song he wrote for this beautiful woman, Taylor. She claims to be a singer he met on one of his walks. She knows she&amp;#39;s not from his world but barely remembers what her own world looks like.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Over time, Willsie and Taylor learn more about each other&amp;rsquo;s music, and they start working on a few recordings together. Yet it could stir up something deeper for Willsie when he&amp;#39;s told by his Goddess that if what he feels isn&amp;#39;t acted on or shared with Taylor, a curse could be put upon him, a curse that could stop any dream of Taylor or music from happening and uncover a dark past and present truth that could haunt or teach him things about Taylor forever. Will he succeed or fail?&lt;/p&gt;" />
