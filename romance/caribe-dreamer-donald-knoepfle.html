  <title>Caribe Dreamer - Donald Knoepfle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sailing is not just transportation as it was in the past. It can be a slow-paced adventure, or a physically demanding, pressure-packed sport like America&#39;s Cup racing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some sailors dream of sailing off around the world like Slocum in the late 1800&#39;s on &quot;Spray&quot;, or Jack London in 1907 on &quot;Snark&quot;. They were the dreamers who actually made it happen. New sailing dreamers are still spawned every day, awaiting the opportunity to push off and &quot;pull it off&#39;&#39;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott Lindsay is a modern day dreamer, and through struggles and determination, made his dream came true. Scott makes his living, as a charter captain of Caribe Dreamer a 40&#39; Sloop rigged catamaran, in the Bahamas. He is innocently thrown into the crosshairs of evil and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the author, Scott&#39;s military training was in the Army, but his ambition is to go to sea. A combination of sailing and military experience places him and his wife at dangerous crossroads, where terrorism threatens the tranquility of the Abacos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tale of romance, foreign intrigue and espionage, combined with the beauty and innocence of the Bahama out-islands and people, is the perfect foil for an international scheme that threatens the lives of Jewish Americans!&lt;/p&gt;" />
