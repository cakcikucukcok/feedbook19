  <title>Ready - Lucy Monroe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="They&#39;re the good guys fighting the bad guys. They&#39;ll get the job done--if the price is right and so is the cause. Meet three sexy men who individually are READY, WILLING, and ABLE to go the distance--and together, are unstoppable.  .  . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a writer, Lise Barton is used to coming up with wild scenarios for her characters, but the one that&#39;s playing out for her right now is no fiction--it&#39;s frighteningly real. Someone is stalking her, someone who knows where she lives and what she does. Someone who has even threatened her family--her brother, his wife, and their precious baby girl. Lise isn&#39;t about to let someone hurt them, so she packs up and leaves Texas for the anonymity of Seattle. And then the threats start again.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joshua Watt&#39;s mission is simple: Go to Seattle and bring Lise home for Thanksgiving or he&#39;ll never hear the end of it from his sister. It&#39;s not like &quot;Aunt Lise&quot; to stay away from their adorable niece, and Joshua&#39;s pretty sure he&#39;s the reason for it. He&#39;s spent months trying to forget the taste of her lips, the feel of her soft hair in his fingers. Yeah, okay, he wants her--badly--but family comes first. But the minute he sees the fear in Lise&#39;s eyes, his survival instincts kick in. The former Army Ranger isn&#39;t about to let some creep terrorize an innocent woman--not on his watch. He&#39;s going to do what it takes to protect Lise and try to keep his personal feelings out of it. Because if there&#39;s one thing he&#39;s learned, it&#39;s that sex and work don&#39;t mix. Not ever. So far.  .  ." />
