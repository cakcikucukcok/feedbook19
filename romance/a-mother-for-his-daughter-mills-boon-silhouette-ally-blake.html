  <title>A Mother for His Daughter (Mills &amp; Boon Silhouette) - Ally Blake</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Just as Gracie had run out of money and was about to book her flight home to Australia, she&#39;d been rescued! A gorgeous Italian had hired her to live in his magnificent Tuscan home and be nanny to his little girl!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Luca was just as thrilled–for the first time since he&#39;d lost his wife smiles and laughter were back in his daughter&#39;s life. He didn&#39;t want Gracie to leave, so he had a proposal for her: would she stay…as his &lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt;wife?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It was the hardest decision of Gracie&#39;s life. She &lt;strong&gt;I &lt;/strong&gt;loved both Luca and Mila–but was Luca proposing because he loved her…or because he just wanted a mother for his daughter.?&lt;/p&gt;
