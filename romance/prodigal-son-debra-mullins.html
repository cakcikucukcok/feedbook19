  <title>Prodigal Son - Debra Mullins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Prodigal Son&lt;/i&gt;--the new paranormal romance from acclaimed historical romance author Debra Mullins&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bounty hunter Rafe Montana is a Seer, descended from the fabled Atlanteans. He uses his inherited power to &quot;see&quot; criminals across the globe and track them down, and he&#39;s just started on a new case. Danny Cangialosi is accused of disappearing with a stolen car...but for the first time in his life, when Rafe goes looking, he is unable to &quot;see&quot; him. Instead, his search leads him to Danny&#39;s stubborn, meddling, and &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; cute stepsister, Cara McGaffigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cara is looking for Danny, too, but not to turn him in. He &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; her brother, after all, and she&#39;s convinced he has a good heart. If she can just find him before the cops do, she&#39;ll figure out a way to get him out of this. But Cara didn&#39;t count on a scorching-hot bounty hunter getting in her way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite instant chemistry, Rafe and Cara know they&#39;re never going to see eye-to-eye when it comes to Danny. What they don&#39;t know is that Danny didn&#39;t just steal a car--he stole a precious stone, a stone right out of the legends of Atlantis. It holds powers they can only dream of...and its owner wants it back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
