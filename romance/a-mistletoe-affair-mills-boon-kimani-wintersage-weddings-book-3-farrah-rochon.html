  <title>A Mistletoe Affair (Mills &amp; Boon Kimani) (Wintersage Weddings, Book 3) - Farrah Rochon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;The Silk Sisters–longtime friends Janelle, Sandra and Vicki–have turned their business savvy into a top-tier event agency. In the wealthy enclave of Wintersage, Massachusetts, there&#39;s an abundance of lavish parties, society drama and longing hearts to keep them busy. &lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Floral designer Vicki Ahlfors is a shy, hopeless romantic. The dutiful daughter of a banking dynasty, she has always done what was expected of her–until she falls for her best friend&#39;s divorced brother.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Attorney turned political strategist Jordan Woolcott has always defined himself by his work. Now at a crossroads, Jordan&#39;s not sure who he is, other than a dad to his young son, Mason. It&#39;s a rewarding job, but being a single father is so much harder than he&#39;d ever imagined.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Vicki has a magical touch when it comes to Mason, and her heart goes out to the overwhelmed Jordan. As feelings grow tender, will an explosive political scandal end their dream of forever before it even begins?&lt;/p&gt;
