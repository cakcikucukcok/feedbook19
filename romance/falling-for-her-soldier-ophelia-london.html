  <title>Falling for Her Soldier - Ophelia London</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ex-ballerina Ellie Bell has twenty-four days left until her self-imposed man-less year is up. No more falling for the wrong kind of guy--charming, sexy, bad. Why can&#39;t she find someone sweet like Charlie, her soldier pen pal? His e-mails meant the world to her, and she can&#39;t stop thinking about him...until she meets Hunter, whose muscles and cocky smile threaten to have her relapsing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before Charlie &quot;Big Game Hunter&quot; Johansson&#39;s last tour of duty, he&#39;d gone through women like crazy. But after connecting on a real, emotional level via letters with his best friend&#39;s sister, Charlie&#39;s ready for a relationship--with Ellie. But then her brother introduces him as Hunter. Proving he&#39;s no longer a player by becoming her dance partner for an Army benefit seems like it could convince both siblings he&#39;s changed. Except the harder he falls for Ellie, the harder it is to come clean. Can he convince her to fall for the real him before it&#39;s too late? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Perfect Kisses series is a standalone, full-length story that can be enjoyed out of order.&lt;br&gt;Book #1 - Playing at Love  &lt;br&gt;Book #2 - Speaking of Love  &lt;br&gt;Book #3 - Falling for Her Soldier&lt;br&gt;Book #4 - Making Waves&lt;/p&gt;" />
