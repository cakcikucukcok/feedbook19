  <title>The Last Voyage of Peggy Jean - Clint Whitehurst</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Last Voyage of Peggy Jean is a love story, a story of love for the ocean and ships by a former merchant mariner and his only daughter. Jim McAndrew and Rebecca Jeans shared love is a sailboat named after Jims wife, Peggy Jean. In the beginning the sailboat is a non contentious member of the family but as the years pass the two Peggy Jeans become rivals for Jims affection; sometimes one, sometimes the other, gaining the upper hand. An important part of this equation is Rebecca Jean, a daughter as much in love with the ocean and ships as her Father but also a daughter whose love for her Father and his approval influenced most of her choices in life. When Jims wife dies, the sailboat reasserts her place in his life but this time Rebecca Jean is left behind. Her Father has taken Peggy Jean back to the ocean alone. But is he alone? Rebecca Jeans search for her Father along the inter coastal waterway and the Caribbean brings home the simple truth that she is by herself and responsible for her own life. This triangle of love between a Father, daughter and a 31 year old sailboat is a compelling love story and one not soon forgotten." />
