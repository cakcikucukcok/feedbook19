  <title>The House on Blackberry Hill - Donna Alward</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;When a young woman inherits a rundown mansion, the last thing she expects to find is the key to her heart...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby Foster is a fish out of water in the Maine coastal town of Jewell Cove. The crumbling Foster estate, left to her by a relative she never even knew, has everyone&#39;s eyes on her--an eerie reminder of the long-buried family secrets that have haunted her...forever. Single, stunning, and sometimes too strong-willed for her own good, Abby&#39;s plan is to sell the house and hightail it back to Nova Scotia. But another part of her is intrigued by the idea of starting over somewhere new--and finally learning the truth about her heritage.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;HOUSE ON BLACKBERRY HILL&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter Tom Arseneault. The best contractor in Jewell Cove, Tom is determined to restore the beauty and prestige of the Foster mansion--and maybe even work his charms on its beautiful new heir. The attraction between him and Abby is undeniable, and the more time Tom spends on the house the more he wants to be in it with her. But Abby&#39;s not sure she can trust him--or anyone in Jewell Cove who seems to know more about her family history than she does. Home: Is it really where the heart is after all?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh, my silly heart be still. This is a wonderful romance, packed with family drama, a sexy hero, an incredible old house. You&#39;ll fall in love from the very first page.&quot;--Debbie Macomber, #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author&lt;/p&gt;" />
