  <title>The Dream Between - Patrice ManShine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What would one do if one were granted the power to make ones dreams a reality, to have dreams that can transcend into reality? And if not there, then where does this all happen from? In The Dream Taker Series, the author has written an engrossing story that revolves around an experiment that could make dreams come true, but with such god-like power how can anyone truly control it or estimate the havoc it can bring into the real word. Perhaps what we see isnt the real world at all? Perhaps were simple characters in someone elses dream? Or better still, in our own dream. 
Project MKUltra is the code name of a U.S. government human research operation experimenting in the behavioral engineering of humans through the CIA&#39;s Scientific Intelligence Division. And officially halted in 1973. In 1977, a Freedom of Information Act request uncovered a cache of 20,000 documents relating to project MKUltra, which led to Senate hearings later that same year. In July 2001 some surviving information regarding MKUltra was officially declassified. The scope of Project MKUltra was broad.
What is real? Some peoples reality may simply not look like at all, what youre reality looks like. Its as simple and complex as that. Are dreams like insanity? And what about the people who are considered mentally ill? Or those who can dive into different dimensions, in their spirituality.  Or the minds while smoking pot? The twists and turns in this book will have your head spinning in some weird vortex, not knowing which way its about to turn. Yet in the end I feel well all learn, what the heck happened, when we woke up, but will it be too late? The choice is up to you, but youll need to decide." />
