RIGHT (The Morretti Millionaires)&lt;br /&gt;Pamela Yaye&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Race car legend Emilio Morretti stunned the world when he walked away from his fabulous career after a heartbreaking tragedy.

Garrison is good at his job&amp;#8212;a little too good&amp;#8212;but he wants to show Reyna that he has since found his moral compass. But as their mutual heat thaws her resolve, will doubts put the freeze on their relationship before he can convince her that they&amp;#39;re meant for happily ever after?&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIN CITY TEMPTATION (Kimani Hotties: Forever My Lady)&lt;br /&gt;Sharon C. Cooper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Former police officer Trinity Layton will do anything to keep her personal security business afloat&amp;#8212;even babysit professional poker player Gunner Brooks. But when the gorgeous playboy convinces her to pose as his girlfriend, she might be the one who needs protecting, as their passionate charade quickly becomes all too real. Now, as Gunner prepares for the championship of his career, he&amp;#39;s playing for the highest stakes of all: Trinity&amp;#39;s heart." />
