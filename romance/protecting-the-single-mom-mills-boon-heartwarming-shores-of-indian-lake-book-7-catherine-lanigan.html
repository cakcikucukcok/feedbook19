  <title>Protecting The Single Mom (Mills &amp; Boon Heartwarming) (Shores of Indian Lake, Book 7) - Catherine Lanigan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Getting involved shouldn&#39;t be this dangerous…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cate Sullivan is no damsel in distress. She’s kept herself and her son safe for six long years. Built a good life in Indian Lake. But now that her drug-dealing ex-husband is moving his operation here, that life is about to explode.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Her instincts tell her to trust Detective Trent Davis. That he’s more than just a handsome cop doing his duty. The former Green Beret has even formed a fast bond with her son. But there’s something he’s not telling her. Some darkness that keeps him from giving in to the feelings she knows are growing between them. Cate trusts Trent to keep her safe, but the real question is whether he’ll trust himself with her heart.&lt;/p&gt;
