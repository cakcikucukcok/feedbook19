  <title>Tempting Texas - Kimberly Raye</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Some things in life are too good to resist.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jenna Tucker has had enough: She wants out of her family&#39;s moonshine business--for good. With her share of the proceeds from a recently-revealed recipe, Jenna intends to renovate her grandfather&#39;s old spread and focus on her true passion: breeding horses. When she finds an old trunk in the attic--and learns a big secret about the long-standing feud between her family and the Sawyers--Jenna realizes that escaping her family&#39;s legacy won&#39;t be so easy. . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now it&#39;s up to Jenna to uncover the truth once and for all--one that could change the history of Rebel, Texas, forever. To complete her mission she must enlist the help of Sheriff Hunter DeMassi. Hunter, a direct descendant of patriarch Elijah Sawyer, just might be the key to solving the age-old mystery.. The only catch: Hunter is handsome as heck, and neither he nor Jenna can deny the fiery attraction that&#39;s brewing between them. Is this a surefire recipe for ill-fated romance? Or are Jenna and Hunter just what their families need to heal old wounds?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tempting Texas &lt;/i&gt;is the third book in Kimberly Raye&#39;s Rebel Moonshine series.&lt;/p&gt;" />
