  <title>Distracting Dad (Mills &amp; Boon Silhouette) - Terry Essig</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Nate Parker had a plan. Find his widowed dad a wife, and keep the old man from butting into his life once and for all! But Nate never dreamed distracting Dad would put him face-to-face with his own Ms. Right. Not that Nate was in the market for a bride…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As far as Allie MacLord was concerned, men were strange creatures–and Nate was the strangest of all. It seemed her handsome neighbor wanted to matchmake his dear old dad and he wanted her help. Crazier still, Nate&#39;s dad seemed to think &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; might make &lt;em&gt;Nate&lt;/em&gt; a good wife. Judging by the insane attraction Allie was starting to feel for Nate, the old man might be right!&lt;/p&gt;
