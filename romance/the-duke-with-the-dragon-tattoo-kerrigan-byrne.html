  <title>The Duke With the Dragon Tattoo - Kerrigan Byrne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kerrigan Byrne returns to her captivating Victorian Rebels series with the &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling &lt;i&gt;The Duke with the Dragon Tattoo.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The bravest of heroes. The brashest of rebels. The boldest of lovers. These are the men who risk their hearts and their souls--for the passionate women who dare to love them...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is known only as The Rook. A man with no name, no past, no memories. He awakens in a mass grave, a magnificent dragon tattoo on his muscled forearm the sole clue to his mysterious origins. His only hope for survival--and salvation--lies in the deep, fiery eyes of the beautiful stranger who finds him. Who nurses him back to health. And who calms the restless demons in his soul...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A LEGENDARY LOVE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lorelai will never forget the night she rescued the broken dark angel in the woods, a devilishly handsome man who haunts her dreams to this day. Crippled as a child, she devoted herself to healing the poor tortured man. And when he left, he took a piece of her heart with him. Now, after all these years, The Rook has returned. Like a phantom, he sweeps back into her life and avenges those who wronged her. But can she trust a man who&#39;s been branded a rebel, a thief, and a killer? And can she trust herself to resist him when he takes her in his arms?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Byrne is a force in the genre.&quot;--&lt;i&gt;RT Book Reviews&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
