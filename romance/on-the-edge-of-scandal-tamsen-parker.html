  <title>On the Edge of Scandal - Tamsen Parker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Snow and Ice Games where competition is not the only thing that is heating up! The third book in bestselling Tamsen Parker&#39;s romance series continues with a female hockey star and her off-limits coach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bronwyn Perry is the star of the US women&#39;s hockey team, and she and her boyfriend Brody Hill have been hockey royalty since they&#39;ve been in high school. Brody unexpectedly fails to make the men&#39;s team but still comes to Denver to support his girl at the Snow and Ice Games. Or so Bronwyn thinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ash Levenson is the coach of the women&#39;s SIG hockey team. His primary responsibility is to keep his team happy, healthy, and primed to win. Though he&#39;s close in age to his players, he&#39;s been doing this for a while and mostly, it&#39;s easy to keep his eyes on the puck. He&#39;s always been able to discard any crush he might have on any of the women he&#39;s coached...until Bronwyn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Bronwyn and Brody&#39;s romance comes to a very public and very ugly end, Ash has to get his star player&#39;s head back in the game and ready to dominate on the rink. Which may mean spending a little time off the ice...&lt;/p&gt;" />
