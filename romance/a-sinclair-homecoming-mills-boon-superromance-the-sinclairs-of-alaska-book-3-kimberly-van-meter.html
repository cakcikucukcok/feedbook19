  <title>A Sinclair Homecoming (Mills &amp; Boon Superromance) (The Sinclairs of Alaska, Book 3) - Kimberly Van Meter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Free from the past &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Wade Sinclair knows you can&#39;t run from the past–he&#39;s tried. After his beloved sister was murdered, he ran from Alaska to California only to discover there was no escape. So when a family crisis calls him back, he discovers therapist Morgan O&#39;Hare knee-deep in their affairs. As soon as he meets Morgan, he feels as if there is brightness in the world again.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It would be inappropriate for them to get involved, yet the spark is irresistible. Wade never expected this kind of joy again. But is he really ready for this? Together, maybe they could find the strength to move on…if they&#39;re brave enough to try.&lt;/p&gt;
