  <title>My Soul to Keep - Ronee Renee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div class=Section1&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&quot;Novelist &lt;span
class=SpellE&gt;Ronee&lt;/span&gt; Renee has a natural instinct for shadowed
storytelling. &lt;i style=&#39;mso-bidi-font-style:normal&#39;&gt;A Soul to Keep&lt;/i&gt; is a
fast-paced, shivery tale, yet its characters always seem caring and real. I
particularly loved the ending.&quot; Rebecca Singleton, author of the novel, &lt;i&gt;Jersey
Blue &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&quot;Mommy, help me!&quot; Four
years after Amanda Davidson&#39;s son Robbie was abducted from their back yard, and
found strangled, his helpless cries still haunt her dreams. Her waking life has
been reduced to an apparently endless hunt for his killer. When a similarly brutal
crime occurs in a small town only six hours from her home, Amanda journeys
north to a picturesque village at the foot of the Adirondack Mountains, where a
sadistic killer has not finished his work. Embroiled in the dynamics of the
town, she finds love, passionate and unexpected. The killer strikes again. A
four-year quest will culminate at the end of a lonely mountain road on a
moonless night, as Amanda finds she has underestimated the depth of betrayal.
The mistake may cost her the life of another child. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&quot;The allure of Renee&#39;s
elegant plotting, the play of her ideas and the engaging suspense, kept me firmly
hooked from beginning to end.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
--Joanne Michaels, author of &lt;i&gt;The Joy of Divorce &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Living
Contradictions &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
