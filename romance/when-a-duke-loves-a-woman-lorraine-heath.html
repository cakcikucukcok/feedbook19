After nursing him back from the brink, Gillie agrees to help him comb London&amp;#8217;s darker corners for his wayward bride. But every moment together is edged with desire and has Thorne rethinking his choice of wife. Yet Gillie knows the aristocracy would never accept a duchess born in sin. Thorne, however, is determined to prove to her that no obstacle is insurmountable when a duke loves a woman. &lt;/p&gt;" />
