  <title>Back to the Old West - Lizzy Eliot</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
When Ella convinces Mark to go with her into the desert it&amp;#39;s just a lark. She&amp;#39;s unhappy with her bland life and dull men. Unfortunately, Mark isn&amp;#39;t much improvement. Stumbling through a portal back into the Old West, Ella learns that the macho men of the era aren&amp;#39;t the men of her fantasies and have no patience with the niceties of consent. The sex, however, is the hottest ever.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
As I patted Mark&amp;rsquo;s cheek, the man walked over to me and looked down at us. &amp;ldquo;Now you are going to show your man you care about him&amp;mdash;a lot.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What do you mean?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He pulled his loincloth up, exposing a rather good sized, erect cock. Not that I&amp;rsquo;d seen many cocks up close, but it was bigger than either Mark&amp;rsquo;s or my husband&amp;rsquo;s. He tucked the loincloth in his belt. &amp;ldquo;You are going to use your pretty mouth on this so that I don&amp;rsquo;t shoot him again.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You said if I tied him up you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t shoot him.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I said I&amp;rsquo;d shoot him in the head if you didn&amp;rsquo;t. Now, if you don&amp;rsquo;t want me to shoot him, you are going to suck my cock.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to have any choice. He leaned his ass against a rock and motioned for me to move around and face him. I knelt in front of him, with his hard cock at my mouth. He took my face in his huge, strong hands and tipped it up. His eyes were hard. &amp;ldquo;Thing is, you are going to make this nice. If you try any shit like biting or anything that hurts, I&amp;rsquo;ll tie you both to the ground, shoot your hands and feet, cut his prick off with a knife and feed it to you. Then I&amp;rsquo;ll leave you both for the ants and birds&amp;mdash;can&amp;rsquo;t say which will hurt you most.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;But if I do this you won&amp;rsquo;t shoot Mark again&amp;hellip; at all?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You suck me off like a top-flight Kansas City whore and I promise not shoot him again unless he does something stupid.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I couldn&amp;rsquo;t trust him, of course, but I sure believed he&amp;rsquo;d shoot Mark if I didn&amp;rsquo;t suck him off. He grabbed my hair and pulled my face to his cock. He smelled of smoke and sweat. I opened my mouth, intending to lick his cockhead, get him wet, but he forced his prick in my mouth, ramming down my throat. I gagged, which seemed to please him. He moved my head, fucking my face. I was doing my best to make him come. I wanted this over with. I had no idea who he was or what his intentions were, but out here we seemed to be at his mercy.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;She ain&amp;rsquo;t half bad as a cocksucker,&amp;rdquo; the man said, and I realized he was talking to Mark, taunting him, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then he started coming, shooting his seed down my throat. I choked on the creamy cum and it ran out of my mouth. At the last minute he pulled out and shot a final gob of cum on my face." />
