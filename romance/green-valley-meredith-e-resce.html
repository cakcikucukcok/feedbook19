  <title>Green Valley - Meredith E Resce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Emily Wallace has been given a choice. Either she marries the much older widower, as her father has asked, or she will be sent to live with her aunt in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emily knows Lord Derikson is not to be trusted, but her father does not believe her. Even with tales of wild animals and convicts, Emily chooses to sail half way round the world, to live with a woman she has never met, in an untamed land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colin Shore has never met anyone quite so elegant or beautiful. The moment he first saw her on the dock, he fell in love with Lady Emily Wallace. But he would never presume she could be a part of his life. After all, she is a lady and he is only a farmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
