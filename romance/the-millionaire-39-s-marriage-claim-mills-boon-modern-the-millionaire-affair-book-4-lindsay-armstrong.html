  <title>The Millionaire&#39;s Marriage Claim (Mills &amp; Boon Modern) (The Millionaire Affair, Book 4) - Lindsay Armstrong</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;First he took her hostage, and then he asked her to marry him! Jo Lucas&#39;s captor is none other than Gavin Hastings IV, millionaire homestead owner, who&#39;s suffering from a case of mistaken identity. Somehow the arrogant but sinfully rugged bushman has found his way into Jo&#39;s heart–even though he kept her prisoner…all night!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And now that Gavin&#39;s met her, he wants Jo for his bride. It seems he won&#39;t let her go until he has made her his.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But the question for Jo is: does Gavin want to keep her because he&#39;s fallen in love with her…or as a mother for his little girl?&lt;/p&gt;
