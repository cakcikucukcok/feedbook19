          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once Pregnant, Twice Shy&lt;/em&gt; by Red Garnier&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tied together by tragedy, business tycoon Garrett Gage has always vowed to protect Kate Devaney – at all costs. When Garrett takes Kate into his arms – and his bed – they never thought this would lead to a baby. And Garrett has a secret that could change everything…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Baby for the Doctor&lt;/em&gt; by Jacqueline Diamond&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A drop-dead-gorgeous doctor like Jack Ryder is used to women vying for his attention. Too bad the only woman he wants is avoiding him. Jack longs for a family – and, after his New Year’s Eve fling with Anya Meeks, he’ll do anything to persuade her to keep their baby!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Her Secret, His Baby&lt;/em&gt; by Tanya Michaels&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Life’s been full of surprises lately for rancher Garrett Frost – and not in a good way. Deciding to take time away to deal with family secrets, he walks straight into Arden Cade – the one night stand who’s carrying his baby! Can Garrett forget his past and look forward to their future?&lt;/p&gt;
