  <title>Born of the War - Kenny Ragland Usnr Retired</title>
      <meta name="description" content="AL ASAD, Iraq 2006 - Mobilized reserve sailor Leigh Andrews finds herself involved in an affair she could never have imagined.
Navy sailor Kelly Raines is a happily married man who cares deeply for his shipmate Leigh - who is also married. Neither Kelly nor Leigh have any intention of falling in love. Even so, a near-death experience for Leigh pushes them past their better judgment, and across the line from friends to lovers. But when Kelly is killed soon afterward by an IED, Leigh is devastated. Even worse, three months later she discovers she is pregnant. Now Leigh must face the consequences of the affair - the possible end of her marriage and the task of caring for the baby she had desperately wanted. Leigh contends with her unsure husband Bill; Kellys widow Gwen; and Gwens angry sister Jane, who plays the mother-in-law from hell role. Through it all Leigh struggles for her husband to accept her and the baby he had also wanted, and for her son to know his real fathers family. Leigh relies on her spirit and depth of personal character to rise above the public shunning, to find the deep strength within herself for family to do what is right, for this beautiful baby boy." />
