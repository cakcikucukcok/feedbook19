      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The second book in &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Christine Warren&#39;s breathtaking &lt;i&gt;Gargoyle &lt;/i&gt;series. Sometimes the beast will only awake if he has an innocent woman to protect...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Art restorer Felicity &quot;Fil&quot; Shaltis can read the magic in auras, but her fascination with a valuable statue she&#39;s asked to locate is magical in an entirely different way.  Drawn to the stone beast in a way that mystifies even her, it&#39;s all Fil can do to keep from being enraptured by the creature&#39;s stone form. At least, until the fierce gargoyle statue comes to life as a powerful, and powerfully hot, immortal warrior ... &lt;br&gt;Spar had no intention of waking unless one of the seven demons of the Dark pushed him to leave his isolation.  But when a stunning, innocent woman finds herself marked by the demon, Spar is instantly drawn to her, will do anything to save her.  &lt;br&gt;With a looming threat to humanity on the rise, Spar has no time to fall for the woman who&#39;s pure beauty commands his soul.  But even the most fearsome beast of all doesn&#39;t get to choose who steals his heart... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Soars with fun, witty characters and nonstop action.&quot; ?Publishers Weekly on Stone Cold Lover&lt;br&gt;Don&#39;t miss the other books in the Gargoyle series:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Book #1: Heart of Stone&lt;br&gt; Book #3: Hard as a Rock&lt;br&gt; Book #4: Rocked by Love&lt;br&gt;Book #5: Hard to Handle&lt;/p&gt;" />
