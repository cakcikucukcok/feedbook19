  <title>These Arms of Mine (Mills &amp; Boon Kimani) (Kimani Hotties, Book 26) - Judy Lynn Hubbard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;When Alesha Robinson ended her torrid affair with Derrick Chandler, she gave up the love of her life. Now fate&#39;s giving them a second chance. But when Alesha asks Derrick to save her brother, she never dreams what the scorned multimillionaire will demand in exchange: becoming his wife–in name only.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Even after Alesha shattered his trust, Derrick never stopped loving her. His strings-attached proposition was supposed to be strictly business: revenge for her cruel betrayal as he rebuilds his public image. Until desire reignites–hotter than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As the ex-lovers give in to their passion, a marriage of convenience is about to become &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt;convenient. And Derrick realizes just how far he&#39;ll go to keep Alesha in his bed, in his arms, in his heart–forever.&lt;/p&gt;
