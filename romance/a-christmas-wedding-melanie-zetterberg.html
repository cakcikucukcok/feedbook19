  <title>A Christmas Wedding - Melanie Zetterberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Penelope or Elle for short is a real firecracker when she&#39;s mad. Louis has his hands full that&#39;s for sure. Elle meets Louis when he comes to the drugstore that she works at every day for a bottle of Coke during his break. She listens as he tells her about his day. When Louis finally gets the courage to ask her out, she accepts. A date right out of a fairy tale for Friday at a Greek restaurant, nothing seems to be able to go wrong. She&#39;s as crazy about him as he is about her. The next day, she can&#39;t wait to see him for his break, but he doesn&#39;t show up. By day three, she is angry. Follow Louis and Elle&#39;s story towards love as they learn that love takes two and commitment is not always easy. It is worth it if you can stick it out. Their journey takes them on a roller coaster ride as they hold on to each other through the bumps that we call life." />
