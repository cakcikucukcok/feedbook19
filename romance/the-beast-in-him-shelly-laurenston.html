  <title>The Beast In Him - Shelly Laurenston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;If you enjoy nonstop laughter, snark, and witty banter.  .  .look no further!&quot; --Smexy Books&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Animal magnetism has a whole new meaning.  .  .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some things are so worth waiting for. Like the moment when Jessica Ward &quot;accidentally&quot; bumps into heartthrob Bobby Ray Smith and shows him just how far she&#39;s come since high school. Back then, Jess turned to jelly any time Smitty got near her. Some things haven&#39;t changed. Except now Jess is a success on her own terms. And she can enjoy a romp--or twenty--with a big, bad wolf and walk away. Easy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The sexy, polished CEO who hires Smitty&#39;s security firm might be a million miles from the lovable geek he knew, but her kiss, her touch, is every bit as hot as he imagined. Jess was never the kind to ask for help, and she doesn&#39;t want it now--but someone is targeting her Pack. And Smitty&#39;s not going to turn tail and run. Not before proving that their sheet-scorching animal lust is only the start of something even wilder.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for Shelly Laurenston&#39;s novels&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;Bear Meets Girl &lt;/i&gt;is hilarious, sexy fun.&quot; --Heroes and Heartbreakers&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &quot;Fast-paced action and smoking hot love scenes.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;RT Book Reviews &lt;/i&gt;TOP PICK on &lt;i&gt;Wolf with Benefits&lt;/i&gt;" />
