      <meta name="description" content="A new beginning . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  A fresh start. That&#39;s exactly what Ally Shaw needs and what she&#39;s found in Glacier Ridge, Montana. Creating a simpler life with her young son and reconnecting with her only remaining family-it&#39;s all part of Ally&#39;s plan to chase away the pain of her past. But when a dangerously irresistible cowboy rescues her little boy, Ally can&#39;t deny she&#39;s excited about what else the future might bring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Reed Malloy was a wild horse who wouldn&#39;t be broken. Devoted to his work on the land at the expense of everything else, he&#39;d never met a woman who could hold his interest . . . until Ally. And now, beautiful Ally and her fearless, freckled child have this cowboy wanting more. This isn&#39;t Ally&#39;s first time at the rodeo, though, and convincing her to trust him isn&#39;t easy. But there isn&#39;t anything he won&#39;t do to keep her safe . . . and make her his. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
