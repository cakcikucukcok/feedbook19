        &lt;h2&gt;Four Passionate Modern Romances all in One Bundle&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt; A Di Sione for the Greek&#39;s Pleasure&lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;br /&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;“Finding my book will take you on a journey in more ways than one.”&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Natalia is trembling. She hasn’t left the Di Sione estate in years, but must retrieve her grandfather’s lost book of poems from formidable tycoon Angelos Menas – who’s just mistaken her for his daughter’s new nanny!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The brooding Greek and his precious daughter were scarred in the fire that claimed his wife, and Talia is drawn to man beneath the damaged exterior. She knows the untold pleasure Angelos offers is limited, but when she leaves with the book, will her heart remain behind on the island?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The Prince&#39;s Pregnant Mistress&lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;br /&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;“I. Am. Pregnant.”&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Three little words are all it takes to threaten Prince Raphael DeSantis’s secret life of pleasurable hedonism, ruin the state of a nation, and find him bound to a waitress.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To prevent yet another international incident following on the heels of his convenient – and very broken – engagement to a suitable princess, Raphael must now make his mistress his bride!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But heart-sore Bailey Harper won’t come willingly. This arrogant Prince will have to use every provocative trick at his disposal to seduce her into submission – and return to his country with Bailey as his wife!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The Greek&#39;s Christmas Bride&lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;br /&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;A good Greek wife…&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Coldly ruthless and deeply cynical, Apollo Metraxis has made a career of bachelorhood. But when the inheritance of his father’s estate is conditional on a marriage and a child, he is forced to do the unthinkable!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Unpolished Pixie Robinson is the world’s worst choice of a wife for Apollo. Yet her family’s mounting debts leave her defenceless and therefore uniquely suitable. But when the wedding night exposes Pixie’s untouched vulnerability, striking a chord in the dark reaches of his heart, Apollo is forced to think again.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And that’s before he discovers that she’s carrying not one – but two Metraxis heirs!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The Guardian&#39;s Virgin Ward&lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;br /&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;He was her formidable guardian…and she craved his touch!&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When domineering Spaniard Izar Augustin was made guardian to innocent Liliana Girard Brooks, he couldn’t have known that the passing years would turn this young girl into an alluring woman begging to be shown the unconscious desires of her body.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For as long as she can remember, Liliana’s coolly elusive keeper has haunted her fevered imaginations. Hoping to sever the ties that bind them, she recklessly gives into one night of sensual abandon, shattering her naïve fantasies irrevocably. But the consequences of that night will bind them together… for ever!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;When one night…leads to pregnancy!&lt;/em&gt;
