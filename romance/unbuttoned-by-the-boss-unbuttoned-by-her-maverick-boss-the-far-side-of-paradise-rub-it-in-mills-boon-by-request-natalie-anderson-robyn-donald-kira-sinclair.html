          &lt;strong&gt;Unbuttoned by Her Maverick Boss&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sophy Braithwaite has always been a good girl and in her new job as tycoon Lorenzo Hall’s new assistant she knows her boss should be strictly off-limits. But the dangerously sexy twinkle in his eyes has Sophy tempted to break all the rules…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The Far Side of Paradise&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tycoon Cade Peredur needs to know why Taryn Angrove broke his late brother’s heart – so he offers her a job to get closer to her. But the moment he sees Taryn’s wild beauty Cade’s need for answers is matched by a fierce desire for Taryn herself…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Rub It In&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Caribbean hotelier Simon Reeves and hotel manager Marcy McKinney have always had a volatile relationship. But, when Simon intentionally traps Marcy on his island, the tension between them evolves into pure, unadulterated desire…&lt;/p&gt;
