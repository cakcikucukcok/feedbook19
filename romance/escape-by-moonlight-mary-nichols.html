  <title>Escape by Moonlight - Mary Nichols</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Summer, 1939. The de Lacey family of Nayton Manor believe they are ready for the changes the war will bring. Elizabeth, the eldest daughter, is due to return home from her grandparents&amp;amp;#8217; farm in France and is expected to marry the dashing Captain Max Coburn. But when Grandp&amp;amp;#232;re suffers a stroke while driving Elizabeth to the station, her future is changed. Instead of returning home to Norfolk, Elizabeth chooses to stay and help her grandparents. Max is also stationed in France &amp;amp;#150; but will this help their courtship, or will the war threaten to separate them for ever?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Meanwhile, in the village of Nayton, Lucy Storey dutifully cares for her father the stationmaster, running their home in the little cottage by the railway. Her long hard days are brightened by meetings with the handsome Jack de Lacey, who brings a brief escape from her daily routine. As their friendship grows, can they overcome the class prejudices set in their way, or will the jealous signalman Frank Lambert succeed in destroying their romance? For all at Nayton, war becomes a time of risk and danger, of secrets and betrayal, and of finding love in the most unexpected places.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" />
