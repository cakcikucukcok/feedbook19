  <title>A Rake&#39;s Reward - Meredith Bond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;A treasure lost&amp;hellip;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
American Sara Whately came to England with a single goal: recover a long-lost family treasure. Her father had long ago renounced his title and abandoned his country, but desperate financial straits call for desperate measures. Gaining access won&amp;rsquo;t be easy. The jewels are hidden on an estate Sara&amp;rsquo;s grandfather lost long ago in an unlucky turn of the cards. And then there&amp;rsquo;s the vexing, villainous, valiant Viscount Reath&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;A jewel of a woman&amp;hellip;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Sinclair Stratton, Lord Reath has always gotten everything he wants&amp;mdash;money, privilege, and women. But after ten years in India, he&amp;rsquo;s returned to England, ready to make amends for his youthful follies. He plans to return his ill-gotten estate to its rightful owner but the man is impossible to find. And despite still being one of the most sought after rake&amp;rsquo;s in town, the bold American beauty he keeps encountering seems to be immune to his charms and dashing good looks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;While Sara has promised to not just search for her grandfather&amp;#39;s jewels, but make an attempt at fitting into society, it might just be that Viscount Reath is the treasure she actually needs.&lt;/i&gt;" />
