  <title>Escaping the Jaws of Life - Lori Godsey Anzini</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a story of a Widow&#39;s journey from grief to life happiness.  Lori, a wife, mother, career woman, politician, and independent thinker, found herself one day without her husband of 36 years, he was the love of her life.
A transformation took place over the next 4 years, significant enough that her depression diminished and she was able to get off all medications that had been prescribed for many years.  It wasn&#39;t easy.  The children she loved could not accept the changed mother.  Even as full grown adults, they were also grieving.
Happiness comes in various forms...but ultimately, she found that she was  happiest when she purposely moved her intentions into pure positiveness, doing the things she knew that felt right.  She became healthier, happier, and significantly drawn into her resolve that if you take care of yourself first, then everything else is better.  Find the joy and fun of being, and dont look back.  
Lori writes in her own words with frankness and honesty of her soul-searching journey through widowhood.  When practicing the art of &quot;letting go&quot; her life dramatically changed towards different path - one of spirituality, mystical belief, freedom, and acknowledging that her path unfolded the way it&#39;s supposed to go, and nothing is ever wrong.
This is a book for those who lost the love of their life.  Many would find  her feistiness uplifting and healing.  This book is a thoughtful gift for anyone struggling with new widowhood, or in the need of finding a mid-life process for reimagining their own possibilities.  Enjoy her view of widowhood from her transformation towards her journey of love.
