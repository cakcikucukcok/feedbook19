  <title>The Poser - Nicholas Howell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the making of this project, my intentions were not to make myself out to be perfect or flawless. If some of my behaviors throughout the story raised a few eyebrows, then good, and so be it. Yet what I was hoping the reader would see as they read through, and would come to realize, is that as my faith in and understanding of God grew, so my behavior, actions, and views, not just of the current situation (as I was once willing to settle then decided otherwise), but myself and where I made a stand (both during and before this chain of incidents) were changed. As I was lighted by the word, gaining both knowledge and understanding, wisdom was near, adding too. My spiritual maturity, growing more and more, was begging to shine through. As the Spirit was shining through and becoming stronger, so I was having the old removed.In writing this, I did not want it to be so that only one who has understanding or knowledge of the word would understand. In fact, I had those in mind that do not go to church or hardly, if ever, read the word. Thus, the reason I used scriptures, in an effort to both get one somewhat familiar with the word and be able to see and perhaps apply it in a different manner. In doing, I am not intending this to be only for the believers or current believers, yet just as well, I know that those who pick this book up and being completely turned off by God or even the very idea of the Most High will most likely toss it aside after the first few pages. Yet for those who have any interest, idea, knowledge, or understanding of God, whether it be from least to greatest, controversial  or acceptance, will be able to read through this story and, God willing, be able to take something from it in one form or another.
Thank you for taking the time to read this story. Again, I would hope that it has in some way given something to you. May God be with you. We are all in this together." />
