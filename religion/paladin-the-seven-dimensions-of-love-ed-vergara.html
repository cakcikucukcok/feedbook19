  <title>Paladin: the Seven Dimensions of Love - Ed Vergara</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lovewe are all seeking it; the quest for it is universal. Even so, how much do we really know about it? Can we really understand its secrets and find love everlasting? &lt;em&gt;Paladin: The Seven Dimensions of Love&lt;/em&gt; explores these and many other questions about one of the greatest forces in the universe. Using the story of Paladin as a framework,&lt;strong&gt; Ed Vergara&lt;/strong&gt; not only examines the many facets of love but also helps us discover its meaning and purpose in our own lives. With this deeper understanding comes a greater ability to both love and be loved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paladin has learned about the universe and time from a beautiful genie and is ready to apply his knowledge to his everyday life and relationships. Still, he realizes that knowledge without purpose is meaningless and a life without love is empty. When the genie reveals herself as a messenger from God and Paladins angel, he embarks on yet another journey of discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you long to know how to love and be loved? Are you curious to know how the Creator of the Universe can take you to the next dimension of love? Paladins explorations are both personal and universal, weaving together themes such as fear, gratitude, and trust, as well as how love overcomes or works with each one. Ultimately his discoveries can inspire you to follow your own heart, find the source of eternal love, and live life to the fullest.&lt;/p&gt;" />
