  <title>Becoming a Person of God - Sunny Philip</title>
      <meta name="description" content="King David of ancient Israel was more than a song write and a warrior. A close look at his life shows an intricate personality with so many ups and downs just like all of us. Called for the great task of establishing the nation at a very young age, we see him cracking under pressure, making mistakes, taking daring chances and taking huge leaps based on his unshakable trust in God. He was denied recognition, he was cheated, he was ridiculed, he was threatened and chased around like a mad dog . But he never forgot his mission in life. He struggled as a husband, as a father and as a leader. But he never gave up. He succeeded in the end in fulfilling his destiny and led the nation of Israel to its greatest heights.
Davids life story is truly inspirational. All of us who want to reach our destiny will find a true role model in David with whom we can identify with and from whom we can learn.
Dr. Sunny Philip covers all the major turning points in the life of David and unearths precious nuggets of  practical wisdom in this book.
Dr. Sunny Philip is the Senior Pastor of Gateway World Christian Center in Long Island, New York. He has degrees in Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Theology. He has ministered on all continents of the world as a Bible teacher and conference speaker. He lives with his wife and three adult children in Long Island, New York." />
