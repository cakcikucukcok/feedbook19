  <title>My Mountain - Cami Marie Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Spiritually, mountaintops can represent grandeur, majesty, protection, and a safe place from all storms. But what describes the climb up the mountains? Difficulties, adversities, setbacks, injustices, betrayals, deceit, conspiracies just to name a few. There are hidden complexities for the mountain climber: hidden vice-covered ravines, slippery slopes, crags and crevices, venomous snakes, unstable weather, little to no vegetation to feed upon. Sometimes sprained ankles, broken bones, and being just too tired to go on!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Compare that to what can happen when mustard-seed faith collides with adversity time and time again. Thats the story of the journey of Cami Marie Taylor whose blind faith eventually led her to the very footstool of God at the top of her own, personal mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will be wasting your time reading this book if youve never had to face a way out of impossible situations with seemingly no answers. But then again, you just might be interested in how Cami was led and strengthened to climb her mountains of adversity!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspirational reading intermixed with practical Christianity best describes Cami Marie Taylors journey during the 1970s--1980s while it also records the great outpouring of the Holy Spirit who accompanied her on her unchartered mountain-climbing expedition!&lt;/p&gt;" />
