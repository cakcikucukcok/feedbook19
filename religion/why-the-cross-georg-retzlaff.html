  <title>Why the Cross? - Georg Retzlaff</title>

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;Holy Week is an almost entirely private
event in our culture. Apart from Palm Sunday and Easter there are no
public holidays, no processions, no pageantry, often not even Church
services to mark the last days of Christ on earth. There may be some
evening worship, mostly poorly attended, to guide us through His
passion. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;But this is a week that deserves our
focused attention even if we are busy and find no time to attend
church. &lt;i&gt;Why the Cross?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: normal;&quot;&gt; is a
collection of meditations, beginning with Palm Sunday, resting
briefly on every day&#39;s events, reaching into Good Friday with
reflections on the Seven Last Words of Christ on the cross, and
moving on to the stillness of Holy Saturday and finding its climax in
the celebration of Easter. &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;This
is a book superbly suited to the needs of those who want to
understand His passion for abundant life, who wish to go beyond the
facile phrases of pulpit lingo, who suspect that He did not come to
die but to live that we might have life. This journey through Holy
Week dwells on the various representations of the cross in art
history. It encourages the readers not just to think about that
cross, but to make it and take it up and follow Him who gave His life
on it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
