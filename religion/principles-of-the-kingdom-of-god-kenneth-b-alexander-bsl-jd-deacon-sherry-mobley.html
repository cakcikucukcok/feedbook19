  <title>Principles of the Kingdom of God - Kenneth B. Alexander Bsl, Jd, Deacon, Sherry Mobley</title>

This Book explores spiritual principles as opposed to the principles of this present age. In everyday life we are well familiar with the principles that operate here on the earth. We know that when a door is shut we must open it in order to pass through. We know that touching a hot stove will cause pain and a burn. Science is aware of the rules and boundaries of the laws of physics and chemists know the results of mixing elements together to cause a certain result. Although there are many of the scientific laws of nature currently unknown to mankind, he continues to strive to find answers and to reconcile the scientific world of which we are aware using out five senses.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What science does not understand, or is unwilling to admit, there is a realm beyond the certainties of this physical realm that is incapable of scientific proof. That realm is called &amp;quot;The Spiritual Realm&amp;quot;. Most deny its existence or if they mentally assent to the possibility that such a realm exists they know little about it and certainly don&amp;#39;t apply it to their everyday lives or scientific pursuits. Some look on such things as foolishness as the Apostle Paul said: &amp;quot;But a natural [unspiritual] man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually appraised&amp;quot; (1 Corinthians 2:14). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, as this book will attempt to point out, the spirit realm is very much a real place, actually more real than our physical world. The spirit world has its own set of rules and principles that govern it. However its ways are past finding out by the natural mind of man and thus invisible to those without spiritual sight. The Apostle Paul said in the Bible: &amp;quot;because the human mind is hostile toward God; for it does not subject itself to the law of God, for it is not even able to do so&amp;quot; (Romans 8:7). Thus our intellect is useless in knowing anything beyond what we can see or touch. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just taking the most basic of the spiritual laws, the 10 commandments for instance, who can argue that we all would be a little better off if everyone was able to follow these basic rules? There would be no crime, therefore no expensive jails to confine criminals. The family unit, which has been broken down in this generation, would stay intact as children would respect their parents; there would be no adultery to break up the family and coveting would all together cease. There would be no serious disparity between the rich and the poor and the poor would be taken care of without great expenditure of funds to do so. There would be no greed, war, competition etc. just to name a few.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jesus said that if we were to pray at all we should pray to God:" />
