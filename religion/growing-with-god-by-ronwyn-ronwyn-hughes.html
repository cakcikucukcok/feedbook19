A word from the Editor - 
This book is written in a way that will be interesting to both Christians and Non-Christians, with the thread of salvation, walking with God and the Holy Spirit carried throughout through focusing on issues and events that are relevant to everyday life.  I have gained much from this book and pray that it will become a light to many others  June Louw" />
