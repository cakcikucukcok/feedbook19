Come with me on a verbal journey in Gods word, The Bible. See for yourself how important the accurate understanding of each and every Biblical word is. Understand in your own soul (your mind) what the substitution of a euphemism can cause. Know what damage the misunderstanding of a single word is able to accomplish in a church and in the lives of people. Discover what the changing of a single word caused in the lives of innocent millions. Find out, for yourself, what these three items of speech, a euphemism, a misunderstanding and a word change can cause. Learn how they bring anxiety, indescribable heartache and sorrow to people whose only desire is to serve Jehovah God. You will be able to see how the change of a single word brought confusion to many people and brought dishonor to the cause of Jesus the Christ.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

If the reader thinks that the Bible is the word of God it is probable that all too often their reading will be slanted by the denomination in which they were taught. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

Entire passages of Holy Scripture become unintelligible. Those types of passages then force the reader to accept their denominations definition. When a reader reads with those predetermined definitions they will miss many of the answers which they are seeking. You see, the denominational definitions cause most of the questions in the first place. What they discover is that the problems they are trying to solve simply increase in intensity. Those problems almost always bring about the conflict between what they were taught about God and life, and the experiences of the life that they are living. Gods word then creates anxiety and unhappiness instead of bringing quiet contentment. &lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-tab-count: 1&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />
