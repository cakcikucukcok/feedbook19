  <title>One Man&#39;s Beliefs: The Theology of Doctor John - Doctor John</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Doctor John was born in Citronelle, Alabama in 1931, during the great depression. Raised in a Methodist minister&#39;s family, his early years instilled a lifelong passion for Christian Methodism. Doctor John initially enrolled at Huntingdon College in Montgomery Alabama to become a minister himself -following in the footsteps of his father-but later changed course in education, switching to a major in Paediatrics. After retirement, Doctor John reminisced on his early years and wrote the book &#39;Our Proving Ground: Memories of The Good Old Days&#39;. Shortly after, he began to meditate on God&#39;s good earth and the people who gave themselves for others, eventually penning &#39;Fifty Two Weeks with God, God&#39;s Creation and Men and Women Who Followed Christ&#39;. Doctor John spent many years reading into religious scriptures and varied histories of other faiths, through which he found a balance for his latest work, &#39;One Man&#39;s Belief: The Theology of Doctor John&#39;. This book explores the evolution of the author&#39;s thoughts and beliefs as he further developed his own vision of God, God&#39;s creation and the will of God for mankind." />
