      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What does it really mean to be broken? To be fractured or damaged and no longer in one piece, or in working order, or to have given up all hope. Have we not all felt this way at some point in our lives? Sometimes it was one major blow shattering us into a million pieces. Other times, it was many small cracks slowly breaking us down. Maybe right now you have been hit and you are falling apart or you are just feeling your purpose slowly drift from your hands. Maybe this happened recently  or maybe it was years ago. Whatever your circumstances, we were not created to live this way. Although our bodies, minds, and spirits may be attacked daily, there is a way to piece ourselves back together. There is a way to find purpose for our lives and to reignite a passion for a more meaningful life. I do not possess a magic potion or equation capable of producing a higher level of living, but I know someone who does contain the answer and I found it  more correctly stated, I found Him.&lt;/p&gt;" />
