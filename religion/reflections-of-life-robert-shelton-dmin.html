  <title>Reflections of Life - Robert Shelton Dmin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever witnessed a sunrise that drove the darkness to its next destination and felt that God had provided it just for you? Our lives are connected to the creation and our spiritual senses are honed when we spend time there. Reflections of Life From the Tree Stand and the Trout Hole is a journal of one mans passage through life. Truth is framed in our lives as we live through difficult experiences. Character, integrity, and values are all firmly established as we attempt to live by the truths that we find in Gods Word.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book reveals that failure is never final, and that success is always fleeting. You will be reminded that a walk in the woods is natures blood pressure medicine. There are stories that will take you back to a hunting trip with your grandfather or a fishing trip that bonded you and a friend for life. There are moments that can never be repeated only remembered. That is the value of a journal like this.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We have become an indoor culture. Our children spend countless hours engaged in mindless but challenging video games. This generation will soon be disconnected from Gods special gift to us, this creation. This book is a gentle nudge to remember our Creator with each new day, and be reminded that every new day has a purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflections of Life wont help you solve a financial crisis, or fix a relationship that has broken. It will however, give you some new ways to look at an old problem. Learning to relax seems foreign today. Vacations are far too expensive and stressful. This little journal may entice you to pick up your fishing rod, or hunting rifle again and re-explore the world that you have forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;" />
