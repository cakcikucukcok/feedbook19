  <title>His Witness - g.k. karimkhani</title>
      <meta name="description" content="CONSIDER THE privilege of sharing these introductory remarks a high and sacred honor. Ive known G.K.Karimkhani for approximately twenty years. I was impressed with his testimony and his devotion to Lord Jesus Christ from the first time I met him. I am proud to have been able to invite him to give his testimony publicly and preach his first sermon from the pulpit of the Twin Cities Baptist Church, here in Temple, Texas, of which I have been the pastor for twenty three years. Watching him grow in Christ has been a blessing and challenge to my own life. Being one of the speakers at his ordination service at Immanuel Baptist Church, Temple, Texas, in 1995 was truly a pleasant, yet humbling, experience. I know of no one who loves and honors the Lord Jesus more than the writer of this book, and Im aware of numerous challenges and sacrifices he has made in order to be faithful to the Lord Jesus. I enjoyed reading this book and highly recommend it to all Christians and the unbelievers to read it and learn more about our Savior. I highly recommend his personal testimony which by itself is worth the cost of the book alone, and it is a soul winner for the Lord. Since about15 years ago, he has served as the pastor of the chapel at the Marthas Kitchen and Shelter for the Homeless here in Temple , Texas. Well over two hundred lost and wandering souls have been saved and brought into the Kingdom of God through his ministry there. You will find that his use of the English language and grammar are unique since his native tongue is Farsi. However for millions of people to whom English is a second language, his style of expression and use of the English language will probably be more easily understood and his message even more graphic and down-to-earth. One thing is for sure: that by reading His Witness you will have to agree that this writer knows Whom he has believed and that he is committed to the Lord Jesus Christ." />
