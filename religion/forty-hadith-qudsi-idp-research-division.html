  <title>Forty Hadith Qudsi - Idp Research Division</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Forty Hadeeth Qudsi (known as Sacred Hadeeth in English) is widely regarded as the most popular antology and the best introduction to the study of the Prophet&amp;rsquo;s (S) sayings. The Ahadeeth summarize the teachings of Islam, concentrating on the following areas; affirmation of the doctrine of Tawheed and understanding Allah (SWT) in all His attributes, the significance of the five pillars of Islam, attainment of virtue, self-sacrifice for the cause of Allah and preparation for the Day of Judgement.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Hadeeth Qudsi have a particularly important status because their meaning is entirely from Allah while the wording is that of the Prophet Muhammad (S) himself. Among the many definitions given by the early scholars of Islam is that of As-Sayyid Ash-Shareef Al-Jurjani (died 816 A.H.) in his lexicon At-Tarifat where he says: &amp;ldquo;A Sacred Hadeeth is, as to the meaning, from Allah the Almighty; as to the wording, it is from the Messenger of Allah (S). it is that which Allah the Almighty has communicated &amp;nbsp;to His Prophet through Revelation or in a dream, and he (S), has communicated it in his own words.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So these are the sayings of the Prophet divinely communicated to him. The present collection has been compiled from all the available books of Hadeeth. The forty chosen here are well authenticated and present many of the doctrinal, devotional and ethical elements of Islam.&lt;br /&gt;
