  <title>Anticimenon: On the Unity of the Faith  and the Controversies with the Greeks - Anselm Of Havelberg, Ambrose  Criste, Carol Neel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Anticimenon of Anselm of Havelberg is both the outstanding medieval work on ecumenical dialogue with the Orthodox and one of the period&#39;s most important explorations of the theology of history. This text&#39;s author was a bishop on Christianity&#39;s eastern frontier and companion to Norbert of Xanten, saint-founder of the Order of Pramontra. Anselm grounded both his zeal for the union of the churches and his Vision of the Holy Spirit&#39;s role in secular events in the renewal and purification advocated by the twelfth-century reformation. The present volume, the first English translation of Anselm&#39;s Anticimenon, sets his work in the context of the early Premonstratensian (Norbertine) thought integral to the reform movement of his time. It renders Anselm&#39;s powerful voice audible to a modern English-speaking readership yearning, with him, for unity in the Church and understanding of the Holy Spirit&#39;s agency in human experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ambrose Criste, OPraem, received his licentiate from the Gregorian University in Rome and is a member of St. Michal&#39;s Abbey in Orange County, California.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Carol Neel is professor of history at Colorado College and has published several translations and commentaries on medieval spiritual texts.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
