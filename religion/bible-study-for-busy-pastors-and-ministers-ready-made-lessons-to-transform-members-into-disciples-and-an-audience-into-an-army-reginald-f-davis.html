  <title>Bible Study for Busy Pastors and Ministers: Ready-made Lessons to Transform Members into Disciples and an Audience into an Army - Reginald F. Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Pastors and ministers have one of the most challenging jobs on Earth. Of all their tasks, one responsibility they cannot neglect is teaching the word of God. Unfortunately, church leaders seldom have enough time to prepare Bible studies for their congregation. This book is a quick resource to help fill that gap. These thematically arranged Bible studies each contain an introduction to a topic and a list of relevant Scripture readings for that topic. Pastors can use the introduction to spark discussion within small groups or to focus on the specific themes during sermon writing. This book will prove to be an invaluable resource for years to come." />
