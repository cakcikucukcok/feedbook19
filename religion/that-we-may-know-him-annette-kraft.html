  <title>That We May Know Him - Annette Kraft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Readers of this book will have the exciting and at times convicting experience of sitting at the feet of the Lord and gaining His perspective of who He is and what His goals are for each and every person He has created. Each day&#39;s lesson was transcribed by Annette Kraft during her times of prayer and Bible study. Included are appropriate scripture verses to help clarify and validate each lesson. &lt;p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Through very simple, clear, and loving words, one can actually sense the power of the sacrificial love of God, our Father, in sending His Son as the perfect example and sacrifice for each of our lives. The progression of the lessons leads one on a precise path of growth with the Savior.  It begins with the initial relationship, forgiveness, and reconciliation, and continues through growing in grace to the sanctification process. There are even instructions about how to deal with the present tumult in our world, and how to depend on God in the midst of all our struggles.&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;These one-hundred-and-fifty-three lessons were received during the final year of Annette&#39;s life as her body was being consumed by cancer. The miraculous way she continued to survive during this period was an indication of the Lord using her faithful heart to deliver such an important message.&lt;p&gt;" />
