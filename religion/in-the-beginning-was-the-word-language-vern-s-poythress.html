  <title>In the Beginning Was the Word: Language - Vern S. Poythress</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Language is not only the centerpiece of our everyday lives, but it gives significance to all that we do. It also reflects and reveals our all-sustaining Creator, whose providential governance extends to the intricacies of language. Writes Vern Poythress, &quot;God controls and specifies the meaning of each word-not only in English but in Mandarin Chinese, Hindi, Italian, and every other language. When, in our modernism or postmodernism, we drop him from our account of language, our words suddenly become a prison that keeps us from the truth rather than opening doors to the truth. But we will use our words more wisely if we come to know God and understand him in relation to our language.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; It is such biblically informed insights that make &lt;em&gt;In the Beginning Was the Word&lt;/em&gt; especially valuable. Words are important to us all, and this book-written at a level that presupposes no knowledge of linguistics-develops a positive, God-centered view of language. In his interaction with multiple disciplines Poythress offers plenty of application, not just for scholars and church leaders but for any Christian thinking carefully about his speech.&lt;/p&gt;" />
