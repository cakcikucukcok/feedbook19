  <title>How to Operate in the Realm of the Miraculous - Frequency Revelator</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Do you want God to use you mightily in performing divine exploits or making a practical demonstration of Gods power through miracles, signs and wonders manifested in raising cripples from wheelchairs, opening the eyes of the blind or instantaneously healing people from HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetics and many other diseases? This book is the correct spiritual diet to launch you into the greater depths of the miraculous. It will teach you how to authoritatively speak Gods word in any situation in order to produce the results of what it talks about.		
This is one of a few books I have ever seen that does not only provide a theoretical perspective about power but practically demonstrates how to move in the supernatural power of God. I believe that this shall culminate in the raising of a distinct breed of believers who shall propagate this world with the supernatural power of God. Contrary to what many people have been taught, it is very easy for anybody to practically demonstrate the power of God. All it takes is simply your availability coupled with Gods ability to display His power. However, it is a typical scenario in many Christian charismatic cycles that people are only taught how to pray, fast, sing, fellowship and preach but they are hardly taught how to move in the supernatural power of God yet this is the most critical endeavour in pursuit of the agenda of the kingdom in this present time. Therefore this book is such an impetus that shall fuel Gods fire for a full blown invasion of the last wave of signs and wonders in this season which marks the greatest hour of global demonstration. It shall provoke a perennial hunger for the supernatural and unquenchable thirst to pursue deeper and greater signs and wonders in these end times.
Presiding over a global network of apostolic and prophetic visions, one of which is the world renowned School of Signs &amp; Wonders (SSW), Apostle Frequency Revelator unpacks the revelation that the days of ordinary Christianity and mediocrity are over hence the reading of this book shall evict you from your comfort zone to tap into higher realms, newer territories and deeper dimensions of Gods power.There shall be an unmistakable imprint of the Divine stamped on the life of every one who shall be touched by the reading of this book." />
