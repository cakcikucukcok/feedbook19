There are other forms of the word which also appear in the holy writ, six of them being in the New Testament and only two of them in the Old Testament.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The word &amp;quot;Covenant,&amp;quot; for the most part, almost exclusively has to do with the Israelites or with a person who was an Israelite. Even its use in the New Testament this rule is not broken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we might say that the word &amp;quot;Covenant&amp;quot; is, in its use in the Bible, very Jewish. Even for us Christians, we are spiritual descendants of Israel through Jesus Christ.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We anticipate that this book may be very enlightening to all who read it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
