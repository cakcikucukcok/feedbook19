  <title>Ye Are the Body of Christ - Joël Hilaire M.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ye Are the Body of Christ presents a deep understanding of the human body to explain biblical concepts pertinent to the body of Christ. When the apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 12:27 concludes, Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular, this somehow echoes the words of King David in Psalms 139:14, I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvelous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well. Pauls comparison of the functioning of the natural body to the spiritual one gives insight into the conversations that must have taken place between the apostle of the gospel of uncircumcision and the beloved physician, Luke. 
In Ye Are the Body of Christ, a book tagged by some as being the first of its kind, the author skillfully uses his deep knowledge of the human body to prove biblical points concerning the Godhead, the meaning of the Crucifixion, and the biblical heart, and to demonstrate the significance of multiple diseases that have plagued humanity throughout the ages. How important is vision, naturally and spiritually speaking? How does our immune system correlate to the spiritual life? Is leprosy in the Bible the same as modern leprosy? What is the hidden message behind HIV/AIDS? Why do we develop cancer? Will we ever find a cure for cancer? What is the body of Christ? How should the body of Christ function? How should we care for the body of Christ? 
It is amazing how the author, who is both a physician and a minister of the gospel, can effortlessly navigate through his understanding of the human body and the magnificence of the spiritual realm. Once you understand the different aspects covered in Ye Are the Body of Christ, your walk with God will never be the same." />
