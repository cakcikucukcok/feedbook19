  <title>Isaiah Homiletics Workbook - Terri L Richards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Homiletics can be done on any book of the Bible, and any chapter of the Bible.  It is a way to break down the Scripture
to understand it&#39;s meaning.  
First, as God Himself said in His Word one must have the Holy Spirit to understand the Scripture.  
In II Corinthians 2:14 the Lord talks about the man without the Spirit of God indwelling him or her and how they are Spiritually discerned.  So, the first step in understanding God&#39;s Word is to have Him through His Holy Spirit indwelling you.  The Scripture is very clear about how this is done, there is only One way.  In John 14, Jesus says, &quot;I am the Way, the Truth and the Life and no man can come to the Father except through Me.&quot;  Belief in the Lord Jesus Christ as being God&#39;s perfect Lamb who has taken away the sin of the world is the only way one can be saved from the wrath of God and have His Spirit come to dwell within.
Once you have His Holy Spirit indwelling you, then you have the One who wrote it living inside you to teach you its exact meaning and how to apply the Holy Scriptures to your life.
Homiletics is an excellent way to spend time with the Father and let Him teach you his word.  In doing Homiletics you will break the passage down into content, division sentences, a subject sentence, an overall aim of this passage, and then application questions to apply the Scripture to your life." />
