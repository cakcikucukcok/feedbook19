  <title>A Grief Sanctified (Including Richard Baxter&#39;s Timeless Memoir of His Wife&#39;s Life and Death) - J. I. Packer, Richard Baxter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Their love story is not one of fairy tales. It is one of faithfulness from the beginning through to its tragic ending.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Richard and Margaret Baxter had been married only nineteen years before she died at age forty-five. A prominent pastor and prolific author, Baxter sought consolation and relief the only true way he knew- in Scripture with his discipline of writing. Within days he produced a lover&#39;s tribute to his mate and a pastor&#39;s celebration of God&#39;s grace. It is spiritual storytelling at its best, made all the more poignant by the author&#39;s unveiling of his grief.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;J. I. Packer has added his own astute reflections along with his edited version of this exquisite memoir that considers six of life&#39;s realities-love, faith, death, grief, hope, and patience. He guides you in comparing and contrasting the world&#39;s and the Bible&#39;s ideals on coping with these tides of life. The powerful combination of Packer&#39;s insights and Baxter&#39;s grief gives you a beacon if you are searching for God, a pathfinder for your relationships, and a lifeline if you are grieving.&lt;/p&gt;" />
