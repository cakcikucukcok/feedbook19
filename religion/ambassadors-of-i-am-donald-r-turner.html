  <title>Ambassadors of I Am - Donald R. Turner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;God did not create us for us; God created us for Himself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From the time we accept Christ as Lord and Savior until we physically die; what do we do? We keep the Charge of the Lord; that is what we do. This charge is also The Law of the Kingdom.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Law of The Kingdom is Love.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We are to love the Lord with all of our heart, soul, mind, and with all of our strength and we are to love our neighbor as we love our self. Love is patient and love is kind. God is Love. If it aint love it is just noise.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
God, in his Word, instructs us to use Love as our battering ram against the gates of hell; He has declared that they shall not prevail against us.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible is our only instruction manual on how to live this life inside the Kingdom of God while still on earth. Gods people are perishing due to lack of knowledge not weakness.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is our obligation and duty to the King, to learn what we are to do and to do it with all of our might.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book is designed to help us to live that Charge of The Lord, by committing our hearts (minds) to live in obedience to The Law of The Kingdom, Love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
