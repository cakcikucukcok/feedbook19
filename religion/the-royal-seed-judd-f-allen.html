  <title>The Royal Seed - Judd F. Allen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you read the entire Bible? Do you skip over parts you think are dull and insignificant? Would you be surprised to learn these passages could be important to you today?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In The Royal Seed: Why the Genealogy of Jesus Is Important to You Today, author Judd F. Allen shares his fascinating and diligent study and commentary on the royal genealogy of biblical figures and its significance for believers today. Often ignored and passed over by Bible readers as boring, long-winded, and even extraneous passages in the Bible, Allen offers a provocative thesis that these extensive genealogies have much to teach modern-day believers about the importance and centrality of a kind of royalty in the Bible and among followers of the Lord. Each chapter focuses on a central figure that leads to Christ and eventually to Christians today. Judd reveals many hidden and subtle relationships todays Bible students may not be aware of. Some of the things youll learn are who Jesus says is the greatest of all men, what biblical book was authored by King Hezekiahs great-great-grandson, and who became high priest Aarons famous great-nephew forty-five generations in the future.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
As heirs in the royal dynasty of the Christ, readers should understand how all parts of the Bibleeven those passed-over bitsare of direct significance to how we can develop a better relationship with the Lord. The Royal Seed: Why the Genealogy of Jesus Is Important to You Today shows you the way.&lt;/p&gt;" />
