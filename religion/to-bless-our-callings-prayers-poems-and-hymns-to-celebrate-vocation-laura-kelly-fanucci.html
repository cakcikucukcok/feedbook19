  <title>To Bless Our Callings: Prayers, Poems, and Hymns to Celebrate Vocation - Laura Kelly Fanucci</title>
      <meta name="description" content="To Bless Our Callings: Prayers, Poems, and Hymns to Celebrate Vocation is an ecumenical collection that supports the callings of everyone within the Christian community. This valuable resource of over two hundred prayers, blessings, poems, and sacred songs from diverse Christian traditions speaks to the heart of vocation&#39;s richness.  -Part I (Ages and Stages) gathers prayers for children, teens, young adults, and adults in mid-life, later, and older adulthood. -Part II (Work and Profession) offers blessings for traditional professions and overlooked occupations--from nurses to truck drivers, janitors to lawyers, salespeople to stay-at-home parents. -Part III (A Year of Blessing) highlights times to preach and pray about vocation throughout the church year and cultural calendar.   Drawing from research with hundreds of Christians in congregations across the country about their sense of God&#39;s call in their lives, the book fills the gap between Christianity&#39;s rich theologies of vocation and people&#39;s pastoral needs in living out their callings.  To Bless Our Callings is a perfect resource for catechists, musicians, worship leaders, spiritual directors, retreat leaders, campus ministers, and chaplains." />
