  <title>Do You Know Him? Jesus of Nazareth - Ikhlas Gracelia Argrett-Suluki</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;DO YOU KNOW HIM? JESUS OF NAZARETH&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus asks a question &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they answered, John the Baptist: but some say, Elijah; and others, One of the prophets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ (Mark 8:27-29).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus asked a question of His disciples that is directed to all of us today. Jesus said,  whom say ye that I am? This is the question that must be answered by us all. Our knowledge of Him is not dependent upon what others are saying about Jesus, but is based upon our own personal relationship with Him. Today, God still desires an answer from us to the question, Do You Know Him? Jesus of Nazareth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do You Know Him? Jesus of Nazareth is highly recommended to be used as a supplementary teaching tool in Church Bible studies, Ministry Outreach, Home Bible study groups and for individuals seeking  a relationship with God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
