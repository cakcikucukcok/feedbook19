  <title>Few Are Those Who Find It - Tena Marchand</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Few Are Those Who Find It emphasizes Gods instructions throughout the Word that will have the reader ready to meet Him face to face at the time of his or her departure from earth.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It stresses Gods repeat warnings to turn from sin, along with His unconditional love, mercy, forgiveness, and grace (specific to its vital role once we receive salvation).&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It reveals the heart that God has been looking for from the beginning.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once understood, this book will lead the reader to freedom from the struggle of self-efforts to live righteously, as well as deliverance from self-condemnation as he or she applies Gods grace to successfully overcome difficult habits.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reader will be enabled to peacefully and confidently remain on the straight and narrow path to Heaven.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God understands our weaknesses, and He is for us. He never looks at us, thinking how bad a sin we&#39;ve committed. He looks past that to the person He desperately loves and wants in Heaven for eternity.&lt;/p&gt;" />
