  <title>Paul&#39;s Concept of Justification: God&#39;s Gift of a Right Relationship - Richard K. Moore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Greek family of words characterizing the doctrine of &quot;justification by faith&quot; (as it is known in English) is most prominent in the writings of the Apostle Paul. It was this doctrine that lay at the heart of the sixteenth-century Reformation; Martin Luther and his followers considered it to be at the very center of the gospel. Protestants came to understand &quot;justification&quot; differently from the Catholic Church they had left. Instead of the Catholic &quot;realist&quot; view, in which God makes a sinner righteous, they came to a &quot;forensic&quot; understanding, by which God, as judge, declares a sinner righteous.  During the nineteenth century a third, &quot;relational&quot; view began to emerge: it viewed &quot;justification&quot; as God&#39;s gift of a right relationship to a sinner. This monograph examines Paul&#39;s concept from three perspectives: the New Testament data; the way the doctrine has developed historically; and how the doctrine has been expressed in English translations of the Scriptures. The author concludes that it is the relational view that most accurately depicts Paul&#39;s concept of &quot;justification.&quot;" />
