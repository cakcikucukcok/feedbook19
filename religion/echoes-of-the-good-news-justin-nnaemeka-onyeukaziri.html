  <title>Echoes of the Good News - Justin Nnaemeka Onyeukaziri</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As Christians today we need to enter into dialogue with the context of the world of which generation we are. The Four gospel evangelists present to us, the Jesus who always engages his contemporary in an intelligent conversation not only on matters of faith and morals but on the entire existential life situations of the people at his time. In the constant conversation between Jesus and his major interlocutors: the scribes, the Pharisees and/or the Sadducees, Jesus demonstrates and establishes that Christianity should have the nature of a rational/intelligent faith and morals not an irrational/blind faith and moral.  Whenever we fail as Christians to act or react to the realities of our world with a rational or intelligent faith and moral attitude we always end up not only becoming inhuman, cruel, exploitative, manipulative and hypocritical like the scribes and the Pharisees of Jesus time; but we also become predators, persecutors, fanatics, enemies and killers of gifted and ingenious people in the name of God. We become stagnant and remain in the past, making Christianity unattractive, sterile and a gathering of people of weak minds, who nourish themselves with fables and superstitions. Thus, Christianity would be erroneously conceived as an enemy to science, enemy to technological advancement, enemy to politics, enemy to Economic growth and entire human development and societal advancements. 
This rational-faith attitude is what this book attempts to expose and invite everyone to have for a better and richer Christian experience in our informative explosive generation." />
