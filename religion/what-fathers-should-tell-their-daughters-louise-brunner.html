  <title>What Fathers Should Tell Their Daughters - Louise Brunner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Remember when your parents told you not to play with matches? You will get burned, Dad warned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Come on, Dad. No, I wont, you may have replied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as a young girl, when you start making decisions, its important to obey not only your father but your heavenly father, as well. While fathers must shoulder much of the responsibility in sharing important biblical messages with their daughters, its also important for daughters to listen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These biblical messages are needed now more than ever, which is why every father and daughter should read What Fathers Should Tell Their Daughters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The devotional includes dozens of Scriptures that will help daughters avoid the pain of mistakes, such as engaging in premarital sex and having children out of wedlock. Just as important, daughters will avoid the guilt that goes along with such dreadful decisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus was tested, and he died for us because he loves us. Show how much you love him by honoring and obeying his wishes by spending fifteen minutes a day for sixty-six days meditating on this books teachings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The key thing God requires of all Christians is obedience to His Word and control of self. This book helps fathers share with their daughters the importance of obeying Gods Word and controlling ones self. &lt;/p&gt;
