  <title>Why Settle? - Deborah Dixon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Every page has a Bible verse, along with a devotional and experiences that I have encountered in my relationship with God. Trusting God; seeking his approval, rather than everyone elses; and realizing that God gives us all the help that we could ever need are all part of completing this assignment here on earth. Learning to take responsibility for our mistakes and using them as future lessons and tools to help teach others are what this book of devotionals is all about. The experiences that we go through in life are part of what make us the people that we are. Our reactions to what happens to us teach us that we do not have to settle for anything less than what God wants for us. Every one of us goes through sorrows in life, along with the feelings of being all alone and needing to find a solution. You may very well find where to look for your solution in this book of devotionals. &lt;/p&gt;" />
