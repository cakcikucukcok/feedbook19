  <title>The Angry Christian - Bert Ghezzi, Brandon Vogt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A needed antidote for our culture of anger.
As both mainstream and Christian culture become more polarized and terms like “age of anger” become commonplace, The Angry Christian meets a desperate need. Not self-help or psychology, this book looks first and foremost at the Bible for answers to the problems of anger.
The Bible’s answer? Christians can be good and be angry at the same time. This is possible, and spiritually healthy, if you allow the Holy Spirit to strengthen you to get angry for the right reasons, and keep your anger under control. Ghezzi also shows you how to:
Use anger constructively
Use scripture to discipline anger
Let anger help you overcome obstacles
“The Angry Christian draws from scripture, life in the Holy Spirit, and the virtues to fashion a response to anger that can become a moment of grace and holiness.” 
—His Eminence Donald Cardinal Wuerl, Archbishop of Washington
“Whether anger is ally or adversary, righteous or right-filled depends upon its when, where, and why. Ghezzi masterfully reveals anger in all its faces, teaching how to harness it for maximum Christian good.”
—Dr. Ray Guarendi, clinical psychologist and author of Fighting Mad
“Anger is the mental virus of our age. It&#39;s an infection that becomes a poison that becomes an addiction, both bitter and delicious. Unless it&#39;s curbed, the habitual taste for conflict can break apart communities and families, and eat away every trace of our inner peace. In The Angry Christian, Bert Ghezzi explains the roots and nature of this emotional slavery with exceptional skill. Even more importantly, he shows us how we can be free of it.&quot; 
—Charles J. Chaput, O.F.M. Cap., Archbishop of Philadelphia
“Bert Ghezzi is publishing an extremely important book for this particular time. Not only are a lot of people angrily reacting against other people and institutions in our society, but they evoke counter-reactions in ever more volatile forms. Bert addresses the reality of anger in human life, its usefulness and its need for control in practical ways that Christians can apply to themselves. This is a book which one can bring to prayer for meditation and from which one can gain much wisdom in a foolishly angry world.”
—Fr. Mitch Pacwa, SJ, EWTN TV and Radio Host
&quot;In these tumultuous times, many of us see something that makes us angry almost every time we log on to our computers. Bert has provided a much-needed resource that helps us understand how to channel those intense feelings into making the world a better place.&quot;
—Jennifer Fulwiler, SiriusXM Radio Host and author of One Beautiful Dream
&quot;We’re taught in church to avoid our anger and the pain that goes with it, but in an era of political, social and religious anger, how do we channel it for good? As Ghezzi suggests in his book, anger can be a slow and steady work toward justice, and a useful tool for the hearts of Christians, if we keep it in check and understand how it works. This book is for the average human who struggles to know themselves and others better in all the emotions that come with relationship, and a guide to help us become more whole along the way.&quot;
