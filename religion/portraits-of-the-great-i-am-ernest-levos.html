  <title>Portraits of the Great “I Am” - Ernest LeVos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Charles Haddon Spurgeon (183492) was an heir of the Puritans. As a beneficiary of the Puritan tradition of preachingthe last of the PuritansSpurgeon set a high standard for preaching from the sacred scriptures by focusing on a specific text for the congregation to understand; he would explain the main words and parts of the text, persuasively proclaiming the gospel message of the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portraits of the Great I AM provides a window into the practical applications and principles Spurgeon applied in his seven great I AM sermons based on the gospel of John. According to Spurgeon, believers who dwell on Christthe Great I AMwill obtain the best apprehensions of the Father through the Son. Jesus said (to Philip): He who has seen Me has seen the Father (John 14:9 NKJV). Author and historian Ernest LeVos has carefully edited and presented Spurgeons seven portraits of Christwho said I am the bread of life, the light of the world, the door, the good shepherd, the resurrection, the way, truth, and life, and the vineand these portraits can be used as a devotional for morning and evening personal worship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spurgeons seven great I AM sermons can help believers be blessed, and they can offer a time for reflection and meditation on the life and the walk of faith. Rejoice that the Father gave us the inspired scriptures to read about and consider, by faith, Gods beloved Son.&lt;/p&gt;" />
