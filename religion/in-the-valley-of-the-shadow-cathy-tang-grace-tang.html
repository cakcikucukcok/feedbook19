  <title>In the Valley of the Shadow - Cathy Tang, Grace Tang</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Our daughter Grace is a special needs child, and her life is full of challenges. Because of her illness, her intellectual development was hindered, and there is a certain amount of stubbornness as well. Yet the Lord blesses her, using her stubbornness as a positive trait. She has a warrior spirit, never giving up and always facing her illness fearlessly. Grace was on an extremely restricted diet, but she seldom complained or whined for the food that she could not take. She never complained about doing blood work, because she wanted to be a brave example to the other children around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I admire Grace because she made up her own story, The Return of Frollo and Sarouscha continuance of the Hunchback of Notre Dame story ten years later. It is my good intention to publish Graces story, not just to encourage her but to share with you our testimony and how Grace touched our lives. I want people to see that behind the special needs, these kids are capable of making a difference in their own lives and others. There are many trials and challenges in life, but only God knows and He is in total control.&lt;/p&gt;" />
