  <title>The Unaware Church - Jan Lohmeyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Teaching Apologetics is a much-needed staple for churches, schools, and individual Christians to continue the conversation of faith based on God&amp;rsquo;s Word. The church needs Apologetics because it helps Christians know their faith, which is sadly lacking among believers.&amp;nbsp;It helps to define and defend the truths of the Bible, and the instruction answers the hard questions that the church is not asking or answering. With this in mind, you&amp;#39;ll find useful tools for adult and youth Bible study groups, with pastors and teachers in mind. One of the sad and alarming realities is the absence of Apologetics in Christian teaching sessions. Teaching Apologetics can be a vital piece of learning and living the Christian faith. Fruitful information is given in this book alongside an explanation for why each church and school should be teaching Apologetics. We also need apologetics to counter the bad image that Christianity has received in our culture. Because of this, too many young adults are leaving the church. This book is easy to understand and was written for every Christian, Atheist and those who are not sure what to believe. If you&amp;rsquo;re having a hard time learning or teaching in the Christian community, you&amp;rsquo;ll find curriculums for both sides of the spectrum. This book tells you what to teach and why. If you ever feel lost or question what you have been taught in the past, this book gives you answers based on the Truth and offers resources for additional assistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book was written as a &amp;ldquo;wake-up&amp;rdquo; call for all Christian churches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is time to tell the Truth, the whole Truth, and nothing but the Truth.&lt;/p&gt;" />
