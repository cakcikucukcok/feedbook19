  <title>My Journey to Embrace God’S Grace - Sue Carabello</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is the story of one womans journey through life. This is my story. You are invited to travel this road with me as I relive hardship as well as all the joys life has to offer. This is an inspirational story. The intention of this book is to show you that, even in adversity, if you set your vision high enough you can overcome anything. With God all things are possible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;As you read, you will see how I turned my misfortune into victory through relentless faith. This book was written to motivate and encourage. I sometimes find myself at the top of the mountain filled with joy and then in the depths of the valley filled with despair. The one constant is that God is on that mountain rejoicing with me and is also in the valley healing my wounds. When you start reading this book, you will see me as the author, but by the time you are finished you may see me as your friend.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;No one has ever seen God, but if we love each other, God lives in us, and his love is truly in our hearts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;(1 John: 412).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
