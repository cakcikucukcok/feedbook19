  <title>Mysteries of Life, Death and Beyond - Patrick J. Conte Md PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book Mysteries of Life, Death and Beyond, illustrates the fantastic odyssey of human kind from the dawn of creation and through the evolution of mind, body and spirit in order to attain our final destination of self-realization and union with the Supreme Creator. It provides an answer to the age old philosophical question, what is the meaning of life? Learn what was present prior to the Big Bang and what happened at the time of the Big Bang based upon our current scientific knowledge. Discover how galaxies and our solar system were formed and how life began on planet earth. Understand the theory of evolution of the animal species and the eventual development of mankind. 
Find out what really happened in the Garden of Eden and who were the fallen angels, and were there really giants in those days? Find out if there is life after death and where do we go. Do we get more than one chance in life to attain heaven based upon the theory of reincarnation? The concept of the triune brain indicates that the human brain is in essence made up of three parts- the reptilian brain, the limbic system and the neocortex, each performing separate neurologic functions but yet interconnected. Find out how each affects our thoughts and actions for both good and bad. 
Learn how the seven major energy centers of the body help guide us from material existence up to the higher realms of spirituality and how you can balance each chakra." />
