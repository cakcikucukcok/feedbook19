  <title>Tyndale Bible - Pentateuch, Jonah, New Testament - William Tyndale, Theospace</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Tyndale’s Bible is credited with being the first English translation  to work directly from Hebrew and Greek texts, and was the first that was  mass produced. This Bible contains the 33 books he translated: the  Pentateuch, Jonah and the New Testament. We&#39;ve now reworked it as an  ebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Theospace works with some of the major Bible Societies in  producing their ebibles, and thought we&#39;d bring the best of our  technology to some well known, and well loved, public domain  translations, including this one. Making the bible easy and fast to use,  adding in various notes and glossaries, without making the text  cluttered, are hallmarks of our approach. Find out more at www.digitalbibles.info.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This version contains :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
- the text of the Tyndale&#39;s bible. Any additional content is hidden  behind hyperlinks so as not to distract from the text itself.&lt;br/&gt;
-  an overview page per book containing a link to each chapter, and to the  index. Locating a passage is much faster than ebooks without this  feature.&lt;br/&gt;
- two indexes. On e-ink readers, several clicks are  required to get to the main index. We&#39;ve created a second one,  accessible from each book overview, so you can get around the Bible  faster, spending less time clicking, and more time reading.&lt;br/&gt;
-  smartphone-adapted navigation. Each verse has a hyperlink to the start  of the chapter - useful for quickly checking the context, or for then  clicking through to the book&#39;s menu. You&#39;ll be surprised how useful this  can be on a small screen!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
We hope you enjoy reading this publication. Please leave us any ideas or messages to improve your experience further.&lt;/p&gt;" />
