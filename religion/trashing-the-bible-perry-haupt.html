  <title>Trashing the Bible - Perry Haupt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In light of what we see happening in our America today, it is my objective to bring up to date some biblical history as to what God intended for us as his creation. Development always displays a willingness or desire to be creative in a positive way so as to show what can be learned and adapted toward a better future. 
God wrestled with his people for hundreds of years in total frustration of them not listening to his strong advice. With this as a background, I have attempted to show us as Americans how we stand before almighty God today. 
I am holding forth the truth as I have seen it in our development of this once great nation. We are a complex people stretching all across America with different backgrounds in ancestry, education, religions, and living styles. So there is no single pattern by which we have all arrived at this point. 
I am not pointing fingers here intentionally but simply trying to get the attention of all Americans as to the unstable ground on which we stand as we move forward without the Bible as the age-old recipe for true success and happy, joyous living among all peoples." />
