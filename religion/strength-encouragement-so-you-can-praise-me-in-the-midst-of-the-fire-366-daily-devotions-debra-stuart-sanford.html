  <title>Strength &amp; Encouragement: So You Can Praise Me in the Midst of the Fire 366 Daily Devotions - Debra Stuart Sanford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Strength &amp; Encouragement: So You Can Praise Me in the Midst of the Fire&lt;/i&gt; is a relatively unique devotional gift book containing 366 devotions written from Father&#39;s point of view. Using this technique gives the book a sense of immediacy and intimacy with Father, and this is the great strength of the book. Though each daily message is short, they are consistently relevant and personal for people of all ages and from all walks of life. Each page contains the very promises and encouragement that will help any believer stand firm in the midst of fiery trials and tribulations.  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;About the Author&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Strength &amp; Encouragement&lt;/i&gt; is a devotional filled with uniquely inspired letters from our heavenly Father for every day of the year. After many years of writing in her prayer journal everyday what she felt like were letters from Father to her, Debra Stuart Sanford felt led to publish and share with others what she believed Father was saying to her. Writing these letters from Father every day helped her grow closer to Him. She began to focus on His Voice and be strengthened by His Words that brought encouragement to her. These letters are written in third person from Father&#39;s point of view. It is Debra&#39;s fervent prayer that all readers will be blessed as she has been blessed from these letters. She also hopes this book will encourage others to listen to His Voice and write down His Words for themselves. &lt;br&gt;Debra Stuart Sanford has been a Licensed Professional Counselor for 14 years, giving encouragement to those who have been brought down by the difficulties that life sometimes brings our way. She is currently working on two more books: &lt;i&gt;Hand in Hand with Yashua&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;What Commandments Should I Obey?&lt;/i&gt;" />
