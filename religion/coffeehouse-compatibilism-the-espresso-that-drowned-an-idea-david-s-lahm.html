  <title>Coffeehouse Compatibilism: The Espresso that Drowned an Idea - David S. Lahm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For centuries, Christians have pondered the following questions: •	Are we free? •	What is freedom?  •	What impact would it have if we weren&#39;t free?  •	Is it possible that we are determined, and yet free in a sense too? •	Is there any way we can know which is correct? •	How does all this fit in to our Christian faith? •	What&#39;s the basic philosophical difference between Arminianism and Calvinism?  Coffeehouse Compatibilism is a fictional philosophical dialogue between three academics and a student on the issue of free will. The three academics: Calvin, Wesley, and B. F., represent the three schools of thought on the free will issue. Calvin, who characterizes John Calvin, speaks for Compatibilism. Wesley, who characterizes John Wesley, speaks for Libertarianism. And B. F., who characterizes B. F. Skinner, speaks for Determinism. The first three chapters of the book contain the arguments and rebuttals for Determinism, Compatibilism, and Libertarianism, respectively. The final chapter integrates Christian theology and the Scriptures into the conversation, ending with a stunning change of opinion for one of the characters. The book is a fantastic introduction to the free will problem for novices and offers a uniquely Christian understanding of this free will issue." />
