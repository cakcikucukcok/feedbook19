  <title>Acts 29 - Dr. Jonathan Schultz, Brian Jacobs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As long as people have heard the name of Jesus and believed his teachings, the Holy Spirit has been at work in the hearts and minds of people. If you have heard the good news about his life, death, resurrection, and the gift of the Holy Spirit, you are part of the continued work of Jesus Christ in the earth. This book has been written for those who desire to better understand the role of the Holy Spirit in the life of the Christian. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The book of Acts contains more than a historical record of the early followers of Jesus; it contains the last words and instructions of Jesus to his closest followers before his ascension into heaven. As his last words, Jesus made a clear emphasis on the power and indwelling of the Holy Spirit upon which generations of his disciples would depend on. The central focus of this book is the nature and power of the Holy Spirit within and among his followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the end, the proof of Acts 29 is found in our living! In a variety of ways, the truth continues to provide an unmistakable bond between each generation of Jesuss disciples. The message Jesus spoke directly to his disciples in the beginnings of Lukes historical record continues to be boldly lived out by millions of believers today. Jesuss mandate to believe and be saved and then to be baptized in the Holy Spirit is still relevant for us today.&lt;/p&gt;" />
