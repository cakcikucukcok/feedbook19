  <title>To the People of Athens, Georgia, and to All Who Have an Ear to Hear - Marcus J. Craft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;/&gt;Its been said that author Marcus J. Crafts hometown of Athens, Georgia, is one of the most poverty stricken cities in America. In To the People of Athens, Georgia, and to All Who Have an Ear to Hear, he answers the question of why so many people in Athens and across the United States are suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/&gt;Delivering a message about the grace and love of God, Craft demonstrates that too many churches are not teaching the true nature and grace of God and all Christ did on the cross. With ample scripture references included, Craft explains how many churches and preachers are keeping its parishioners in bondage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/&gt;To the People of Athens, Georgia, and to All Who Have an Ear to Hear shows Christians how to live a life of abundance and a life of joy and peace. It shows how to live in the finish work of Christ, the kind he died for.&lt;/p&gt;" />
