  <title>Christ&#39;s Ascension and Second Coming from Heaven - Dr. C. Matthew McMahon, Christopher Love</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Christopher Love (1618-1651) was a fiery and practical Puritan preacher. His works consist of some of the best written and preached biblical expositions in print.  Christopher Love harvests sweet biblical honey from the word of God concerning the ascension of Jesus Christ, and the coming of Christ again to judgment. Though Love carefully refutes theological ideas such as the 1000 year earthly millennial reign of Christ, and the idea of soul sleep, he is more focused on demonstrating the sweetness and benefits of Christ&#39;s ascension and second coming. His main text is John 14:3, &quot;And if I go and prepare a place for you. I will come again and receive you unto myself, that where I am, there ye may be also.&quot; Christ&#39;s ascension is a ground of great comfort and great advantage to all God&#39;s people while they dwell here on earth.   This work is not a scan or facsimile, has been carefully transcribed by hand being made easy to read in modern English, and has an active table of contents for electronic versions." />
