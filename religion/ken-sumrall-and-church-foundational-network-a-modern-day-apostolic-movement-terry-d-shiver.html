  <title>Ken Sumrall and Church Foundational Network: A Modern-Day Apostolic Movement - Terry D. Shiver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the first extensive examination of the life of Ken Sumrall and his firm belief in the modern-day apostolic restoration movement. It presents Sumrall&#39;s journey from his Baptist beginnings, through his experience of the baptism of the Holy Spirit, through his learning struggles with Liberty Fellowship of Churches and Ministers, and into his birthing of Church Foundational Network. It represents Sumrall in his own light, while dealing with his paradigm changes concerning church government the heart of which revolved around the restoration of modern-day apostles. Godly government was grounded in godly relationships with one&#39;s apostle, whom Sumrall understood as a &quot;spiritual father.&quot; For Sumrall, the best biblical government for the New Testament church today is a theocracy. Instead of a centralized, hierarchical church government, Sumrall advanced a decentralized network of churches connected relationally.   This volume contains the major influences upon Sumrall&#39;s thinking and the progress of his comprehension of the life of the church as &quot;family.&quot; Moreover, it engages some of the apprehensions that have surfaced over the present-day apostolic movement and provides insights of the direction and survivability of the movement." />
