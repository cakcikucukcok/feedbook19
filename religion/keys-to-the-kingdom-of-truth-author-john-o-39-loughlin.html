This, to put it mildly, is simply the crowning achievement of John O&#39;Loughlin&#39;s philosophical oeuvre, of his quest for philosophical perfection through the pursuance and comprehension of Truth, whether interpreted specifically in relation to Metaphysics or more generally in relation to each of the atomic and pseudo-atomic options, and one can only add that if there was ever a book  more comprehensively exacting and logically consistent within terminological frameworks that are often if not usually unique, then it would have to be this one, for which we must all be both amazed and, I guess, thankful.
