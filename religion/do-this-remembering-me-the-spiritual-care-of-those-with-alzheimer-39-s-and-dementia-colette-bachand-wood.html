  <title>Do This, Remembering Me: The Spiritual Care of Those with Alzheimer&#39;s and Dementia - Colette Bachand-Wood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="• 5 million+ in the U.S. live with Alzheimer&#39;s, 5.5 million caregivers provide 17.7 billion hours&#39; unpaid care (2013) • Key resource of practical tools/real-life applications for spiritual and physical dementia ce  &quot;What do I do to help?&quot;  Alzheimer&#39;s is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, almost everyone knows someone with some form of dementia, yet few know how to answer that question, and very little material exists on providing spiritual care to adults with dementia-related diseases. Even seminaries rarely provide training or clinical pastoral education in this field.  This book is an answer. It provies a hands-on manual that will give clergy, spiritual care providers, and family members an understanding of the ongoing spiritual needs of individuals with dementia, as well as practical tools such as how to create a religious service in a memory care unit and how one might plan a nursing home visit. Accessibly written, with real life applications and sample services for a variety of settings. More than just useful, the book inspires with shared stories that are tender, sad, funny-and sometimes all three at once, encouraging readers to develop spiritual care ministries for people with memory loss in congregations, homes, nursing facilities, or other communities-a ministry that will only gain in importance in the coming decade, as Baby Boomers age and the number of people with Alzheimer&#39;s and dementia skyrockets.   Audience:  Clergy, pastoral care providers, family members of dementia patients, Stephen&#39;s Ministries, hospital / nursing home chaplains, seminarians, CPE training - for those who wish" />
