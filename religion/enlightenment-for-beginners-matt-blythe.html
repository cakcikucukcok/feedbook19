  <title>Enlightenment for Beginners - Matt Blythe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Inside Enlightenment for Beginners, the author guides us gently and clearly through learning to cope with our feelings, mind, body and spirit, attracting a love partner, forgiveness, the psychology of personal repair, meditation, the law of psychosomatics, the seven chakras, aura, your pseudo soul or ego, the feminine principle, goal setting, finding your purpose, principles for decision making and living your purpose wholeheartedly, plus many more chapters for those serious about their own personal development and spiritual growth.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Complete with informative and simple diagrams, exercises and quite a lot of humour, Enlightenment for Beginners is the essential handbook for anyone from those wanting to improve the quality of their life to those embarking on their own personal enlightenment.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&quot;The aim of this book is largely reparative. I wrote it myself during testing times both emotionally and financially. The principles and aphorisms contained herein became a staff for me at the time and many of these formed the basis of the belief system that supports my psychology. They transformed the most chronic of problems easily and became the cornerstones and building blocks for a brighter, more positive future. Enlightenment for Beginners aims to educate and enlighten you, increase your awareness and give you an expanded view of what we call life. I hope to share this knowledge with you it comes from the depths of my awareness. With understanding and a solid foundation every problem we encounter becomes a way of extending ourselves and transforms into a gift. After taking &quot;The Road to Recovery&quot; and a short journey within, we can safely and confidently return to the mainstream of life with renewed interest and energy. Seeing where we are now, and how far we have come, allows us to settle into life knowing we are guided, gifted, supported and rewarded, throughout this intrinsic tapestry of life. I hope you have at least as much fun reading Enlightenment for Beginners as I did writing it. If I can help one person walk into the future with an open mind and a grateful heart then it would all have been worthwhile.&quot; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Matt Blythe&lt;b&gt;" />
