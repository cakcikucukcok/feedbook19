  <title>Rethinking Our Story: Can We Be Christian in the Quantum Era? - G. Douglas Hammack</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If it ain&#39;t broke, don&#39;t fix it. But it&#39;s no secret that the Christian church is broke, and does need fixing.   Despite great effort, things are going badly for us. We&#39;ve tried trendy and tech-savvy, entrepreneurial and coffee-house gritty. They&#39;re not helping. Our problem is deeper than that. Our problem is our instincts--instincts informed by our story. There was a time when the Christian church was a powerfully transformative presence in society. It can be again--but it will require radical rethinking of the story that informs our instincts. And it&#39;s time! It&#39;s been five hundred years since the Reformation, our last major update. Today is a pivotal moment in history. With our worldview upended by quantum physics, history is demanding we renew the Christian story for our times.   Rethinking Our Story reframes the elements of the Christian narrative for the new era. It explores quantum ways of thinking about God, human nature, Jesus, salvation, and the afterlife. The future of the church and the health of our society depend on our willingness to rethink, retell, and live out a better story. We will either update our instincts and contribute to the earth&#39;s well-being--or disappear into oblivion." />
