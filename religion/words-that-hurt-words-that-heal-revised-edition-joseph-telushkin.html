  <title>Words That Hurt, Words That Heal, Revised Edition - Joseph Telushkin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Rebbe&lt;/em&gt; comes this newly revised edition of &lt;em&gt;Words That Hurt, Words That Heal&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8212;an invaluable guide in how choosing the right words can enrich our relationships and give us insight to improve every facet of our lives.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t know anyone whose life would not be blessed by this book.&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;Rabbi Harold S.

With wit and wide-ranging intelligence, Rabbi Telushkin explains the harm in spreading gossip, rumors, or others&amp;#8217; secrets, and how unfair anger, excessive criticism, or lying undermines true communication. By sensitizing us to subtleties of speech we may never have considered before, he shows us how to turn every exchange into an opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this fully revised edition, Joseph Telushkin brings this classic into the modern age. Remarkable for its clarity and practicality, &lt;em&gt;Words That Hurt, Words That Heal&lt;/em&gt; illuminates the powerful effects we create by what we say and how we say it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
