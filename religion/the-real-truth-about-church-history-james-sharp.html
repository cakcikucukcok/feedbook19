  <title>The Real Truth About Church History - James Sharp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Real Truth About Church History answers the following questions: Why is Christianity the way that it is today? And how did we go from one church to over 34,000 Christian denominations worldwide? This is a huge problem because the world has acknowledged this fact. And the fact is this: A church divided is no church at all. So in order to end the division in Christianity, we must all go back to the Bible and the past. It is time for all Christians to speak the same things that were spoken by Christ, the apostles, and the saints of old after the Apostolic Age.
This book educates you on the hidden facts about primitive Christianity by covering the first 5 centuries of the history of the church. The things that the average Christian have not been taught have been brought out more clearly in this book. Also, this book shoots documented facts that cannot be refuted. Now, more than ever, there must be complete and utter unity in the body of Christ. We&#39;re living in the last days, so it&#39;s time for all Christians to speak the same thing by the Word of God." />
