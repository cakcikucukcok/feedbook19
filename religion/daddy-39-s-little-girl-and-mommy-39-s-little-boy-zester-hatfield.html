  <title>Daddy&#39;s Little Girl and Mommy&#39;s Little Boy - Zester Hatfield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
Mr. Hatfield with all of his years of experience in marriage, parenting, family, missions and in the Church pulls no punches in calling Christ&#39;s Bride to return to His Truth (God&#39;s revealed Law-Word) regarding discipleship (men and women of faith and grace) in Manhood and Womanhood, outrageously successful spousal relations, parenting with training in romance, sexual satisfaction, love and marriage! He is calling all believers, especially men, to confession and repentance and to receive, understand and apply these Truths in the Power of the Holy Spirit as the only acceptable response in which God will revive and reform the Family and the Church in the 21st Century! Not for the weak-kneed, weak-minded or humanistically influenced, this is for Christ&#39;s Bride as we prepare for and anticipate His return!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 These applications of God&#39;s revealed Law-Word and His uncommon common sense in the lives of America&#39;s postmodern Christian culture and especially the promise of duplicating of these successes for love and marriage in our children, is exciting and challenging to the point of precedent setting magnitudes. The reader will experience riveting and exciting challenges to the status quo of our present day Christian culture.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&quot;Based on interviews with more than 1000 adults nationwide, the survey discovered that less than one out of every five adults believes that children under the age of 13 are being &quot;superbly&quot; or &quot;pretty well&quot; prepared for life emotionally, physically, spiritually, intellectually or physically. Fewer than one out of every twenty adults believes that America&#39;s youngsters are receiving above average preparation in all five of those areas of life.&quot; Americans Agree: &quot;Kids Are Not Being Prepared for Life,&quot; The Barna Group-October 26, 2004 
The couples, who discover the answers to the moral morass of our postmodern Christian culture, are those who know that the future of their children is in jeopardy and that we are in a war for the control of that future! Sadly, the statistics of broken homes, divorces, adultery, domestic violence, drugs and promiscuity - to mention only some of the ills of our culture - are almost equally divided between &quot;Christian&quot; families and non-Christian families. This is unacceptable as a comparison and must change. Consequently, fathers and mothers of faith and grace are those - who are and or who will experience - God&#39;s promise of victory over these fruits of our fallen nature and live a marriage experience that captures the best of God&#39;s gifts of love, sex and romance in marriage.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Daddy&#39;s Little Girl and Mommy&#39;s Little Boy&lt;/b&gt; brings us clear evidence of just how America&#39;s Christian couples can have this victory in their marriage and how to duplicate this success in their sons and daughters.
