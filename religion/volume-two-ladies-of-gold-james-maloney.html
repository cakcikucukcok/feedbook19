  <title>Volume Two Ladies of Gold - James Maloney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The second of three volumes, Ladies of Gold: The Remarkable Ministry of the Golden Candlestick continues the comprehensive presentation of the visions of the King of Kings experienced by Frances Metcalfe and the other members of the Golden Candlestick. This fellowship of Christians attuned to the guidance of the Holy Spirit shared these visions with others, communicating the essence of their moments of rapture when they were translated into the heavenly realms.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Maloney, a leader in developing ministers and supporting overseas crusades, has compiled and presented a comprehensive collection of the recorded utterances flowing from the people of the Golden Candlestick. This collection presents eight visions and a miscellany of excerpts that give a taste of the riches recorded in journals, missionaries notes, and newsletters.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The Spirit spoke to the members of the fellowship of believers in the Golden Candlestick for more than fifty years. If you are curious about how their visions might touch your own life, if you desire to know more about Gods work in the world, or if you are a student of religious experience, then Ladies of Gold: The Remarkable Ministry of the Golden Candlestick will reward you for your attention.&lt;/p&gt;" />
