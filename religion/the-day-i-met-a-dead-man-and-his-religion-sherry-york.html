  <title>The Day I Met a Dead Man and His Religion - Sherry York</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to meet the dead? It is possible to meet the evil spirit that controlled a man while he was living. There is one God and one Holy Spirit but with Satan there are many spirits. When a man that was controlled by an evil spirit, dies, that evil spirit moves on to another yielding vessel. This is why we can execute serial killers or take down evil leaders and yet another one will arise.  We as humans were created in the image of God. We were given freewill to either yield to Him (God) or Satan.  &lt;i&gt;The Day I Met a Dead Man and His Religion&lt;/i&gt; was a day I will never forget.  A man by the name of John Calvin, who had been dead for hundreds of years, is still alive today and teaching his false doctrine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My meeting Calvin set me on a quest to prove the gospel of Jesus Christ and to prove Calvins religion to be the hopeless false teaching that it is! You are invited to go on this journey with me, a journey for Gods truth. Are we born sinners? Do we have freewill? Who are the elect? Did God create hell for man? Is there an age of accountability? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we allow Gods Word to be preached as a lie then eventually you wont even remember the truth anymore.&lt;/p&gt;" />
