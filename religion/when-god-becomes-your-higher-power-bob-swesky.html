      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If you would like to live forever in a world that dreams are made of and some minds visit occasionally, then within these pages , you will find someone who can show you how. Greatest of all, this new life starts here on earth! Most of mankind has gotten their priorities backward. People seek to find happiness, a purpose in life, and answers to questions that only God can reveal. Seek God first, and the unseen things in our&amp;nbsp;world will be seen. Too often we forget God&amp;#39;s presence in this world because of the many thoughts invading our minds; thoughts of work, personal needs, wants and desires; everyone and everything but Him. Discover how God&amp;#39;s presence in your life can be real, meaningful, and satisfying beyond anything ever imagined. Let God become your higher power, and He will open your eyes and ears to a world unseen before; yet is as real as the world in which you are living in.&lt;/p&gt;" />
