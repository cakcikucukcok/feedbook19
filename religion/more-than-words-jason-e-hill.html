  <title>More Than Words - Jason E. Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We live in a world in which there is great confusion about what it means to be a Christian and what it means to have genuine faith. Faith is more than belief, and being a Christian is more than attending a church service, a Bible study, or helping out the poor and needy. True faith, genuine faith in Christ, is not something that we need to convince people that we possess. Instead, true faith is seen through who we are and what we do. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;More Than Words &lt;/i&gt;is a book about faith. It is not so much a book about what faith is but instead what true faith looks like. &lt;i&gt;More Than Words&lt;/i&gt; is a practical study of the book of James and provides understanding to what a life truly surrendered to Christ looks like and how it is to be lived.  &lt;i&gt;More Than Words&lt;/i&gt; will encourage  and challenge you to examine your hearts and  life to see if the faith  you claim to have is truly a biblical faith.&lt;p&gt;" />
