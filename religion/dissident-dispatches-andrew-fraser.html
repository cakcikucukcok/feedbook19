  <title>Dissident Dispatches - Andrew Fraser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dissident Dispatches&lt;/em&gt; is about Christian theology. It also gives voice to the ethno-patriotic concerns now fuelling the growth of the secular Alt-Right movement. Both reject the ongoing spiritual degeneration and concomitant demographic displacement of every white European ethno-nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author, Andrew Fraser, has studied and taught history and law at leading universities in Canada, the United States, and Australia. He was born a British subject when people of British stock still counted as one of Canada&amp;rsquo;s two &amp;ldquo;founding races&amp;rdquo;. Indeed, at that time, there was no such thing as a &amp;ldquo;Canadian citizen&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &amp;ldquo;late loyalist&amp;rdquo; in his own personal development, Fraser deplores the ethno-masochistic eagerness with which far-too-many other WASPs still spit upon the graves of their ancestors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He recognizes, however, that it is not enough to mourn the loss of once-secure and legitimate ethno-religious identities. Nor will politics alone save us. &lt;em&gt;Dissident Dispatches &lt;/em&gt;outlines the fundamental elements of the Christian ethno-theology sorely needed by the Alt-Right if it is to halt, much less reverse, the rising tide of colour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dissident Dispatches &lt;/em&gt;identifies the main currents in modern Christian theology responsible for the moral and spiritual collapse of both the Anglican Church and Christendom more generally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the rusted-on secularism of the Alt-Right, the book offers a critical comparative analysis of the major alternatives to a Christian ethno-theology; namely, the political theology of popular sovereignty and the cornucopian civil religion of perpetual progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across a wide range of issues in systematic and practical theology, in bible studies and church history, the essays collected here provide the basic ingredients for the counter-revolutionary theology of Christian nationhood needed in contemporary debates with Christian universalists and disingenuous white liberals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book counters the Christophobia endemic among neo-pagan white nationalists with an intellectually respectable Christian apologetic as well as a biblical hermeneutic informed by both &amp;ldquo;kinism&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;aka&lt;/em&gt; covenantal creationism) and &amp;ldquo;preterism&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;aka&lt;/em&gt; covenant eschatology).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;Dissident Dispatches &lt;/em&gt;is more than a theological treatise. It is also a personal memoir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author, Andrew Fraser, is a racially aware, former law professor who became a theology student at a divinity school in suburban Sydney, Australia. He discovered there a multiracial college community of professedly Christian teachers and students promoting the postmodern cult of the &amp;ldquo;Other&amp;rdquo;. There, to be Christian is to celebrate the fact that Australia, Canada, the United States, even England, are no longer &amp;ldquo;Anglo-Saxon countries&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following in the author&amp;rsquo;s footsteps from one class to another, the book provides insight into the academic and personal problems likely to face pro-white students engaging in politically-incorrect speech or behaviour in a divinity school anywhere in the white, English-speaking world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author has considerable personal experience on the receiving end of politically correct thought policing. Early on, &lt;em&gt;Dissident Dispatches &lt;/em&gt;explores the background to the one-year suspension meted out to the author for &amp;ldquo;offending&amp;rdquo; faculty members and/or female and ethnic students by the allegedly racist, sexist, and anti-Semitic remarks made by him in classes and seminars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dissident Dispatches&lt;/em&gt; is the unplanned product of the culture shock experienced on all sides when an Alt-Right senior citizen &lt;em&gt;cum &lt;/em&gt;cultural warrior decides to rattle his politically-correct bars by going to a theological college run by a church often confused with the Communist Party at prayer.&lt;/p&gt;" />
