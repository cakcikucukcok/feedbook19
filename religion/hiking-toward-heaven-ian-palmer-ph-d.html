  <title>Hiking Toward Heaven - Ian Palmer Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An adventurous series of hikes in the mountains and canyons of the Southwest United States An encounter with a mysterious stranger who makes an intriguing proposition  An exploration into the powerful Christian themes oflove, grace, and forgiveness  A new formula for dealing with obstacles that life puts in our way  Glimpses of heaven we can identify with  Altogether, an uplifting reminder of that key Christian attitude --hope --with practical encouragement for tough economic times  Packed with wisdom and spiced with intrigue, this book views all these aspects through the wide-open eyes of children and the experienced eyes of a scientist. It is an enchanting storythat rocks along from one hiking episode to the next, all on the edge of Gods interaction with humankind. The mystery is engaging, and the emotions are stirring enough to bring a tear to the eye.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The book Hiking Toward Heaven is full of life experiences I can relate to. Ian lets us know there are angels leading us all through our lives. I did not want to put the book down, and I wanted more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;-- Dewey Flock, Home Improvement Contractor, Houston, Texas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Amidst the joys and diffi culties of each exciting hike, the Christian message comes through loud and clear. I have never seen anything quite like it, and as you describe the fl ora, the geology, and the food of various places, it hasthe ring of truth.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;--Julian Pfi tzner, High school teacher and administrator (retired), Adelaide, Australia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The book takes the reader on a fascinating jaunt of geographical discovery, and sparkles with the quoted jewels of wise men. The wonderful surprises that are portrayed when life gets tough give me renewed hope.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;--Bob Moulton, Melrose, Australia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ian has combined his passion for hiking in the Southwest USAwith his immense love of God in a tale that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The people who share the trails experience Gods message of love, grace, and hopewhich culminates in the challenge Seeing is believing, but you will also learn that believing is seeing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;-- Ginny Itz, Director of Singles at Chapelwood United Methodist Church, Houston, Texas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I plan to integrate this book into our curriculum for youth in detention. I strongly believe these at-risk youth will receive and welcome this novel presentation of Biblical truths.&lt;br /&gt;
