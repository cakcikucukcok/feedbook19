  <title>Finding God in a Broken World - John R. Clarke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There is no doubt that we are entering the final stages of the history of this world. Lawlessness abounds, terrorism is on the increase, and wars and rumors of war abound. Natural disasters such as tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, cyclones, floods, and tornados are also becoming more common as the earth struggles under the burden of humankinds rebellion. So what does the future hold for the beloved of Christ? 
Finding God in a Broken World provides insight into the steps to remaining free in Christ during the turbulent days ahead. The book explores seven key areasfrom embracing the love of God, finding Gods purpose for our lives, and overcoming the world, to living the victorious Christian life and remaining free in Christ, regardless of the circumstances we find ourselves facing in the coming days. Author John R. Clarkes scientific background gives him a distinctive insight into the Bible and the Word of God, and it allows for a different perspective on the events of the end times and Christian living than those normally provided by theologians.
Although the times of the last days can be fraught with tension, unease, and even hostility, it is important for Christians to know that by understanding the difficult aspects of Gods teachings, his positive purposes and his plans for eternity will come into better perspective. By meditating on these teachings, the hope and prayer is that believers can find inspiration, comfort, and blessings." />
