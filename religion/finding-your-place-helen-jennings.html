  <title>Finding Your Place - Helen Jennings</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The purpose of my story is to leave a legacy that will point the next generation to the faithfulness of Gods love and to make them aware that with God, all things are possible. God can turn the worst situation into something wonderful like he did for me. I believe that although everyone is created for greatness, without motivation, it could take a lifetime to discover the true talents he or she has hidden inside. After missing out on numerous childhood dreams, I was motivated to write my story, Finding Your Place, in the hope of encouraging others not to give up. My story is a living testimony that Gods love is the source of ones strength. Despite the many hurdles that life throws at us, Gods love never fails! Instead, his love has guided me to discovering my true purpose. I trust that my story, Finding Your Place, will inspire someone out of their struggles and lead many more souls to the kingdom of God." />
