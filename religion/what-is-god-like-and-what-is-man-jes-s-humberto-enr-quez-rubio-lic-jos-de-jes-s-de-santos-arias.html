  <title>What Is God Like? and What Is Man? - Jesús Humberto Enríquez Rubio, Lic. José de Jesús de Santos Arias</title>
      <meta name="description" content="WHAT IS GOD LIKE? AND WHAT IS MAN? 
Once again, God talks to man, this time through this book. Seven brief messages sufficed for God to describe Himself and talk about who He is, what He does, what He expects, why He created man and how this creation takes place, what elements He bestowed upon man, and how He portrays Himself in man, His opus magnum. It also describes what God expects us to achieve and what destiny has in store for all of us. IT IS CRUCIAL FOR EVERYONEREGARDLESS OF SEX, RELIGION, OR OF THE CONCEPT WE HAVE ABOUT GODTO READ THIS BOOK TO TRULY KNOW GOD, WITHOUT THE NEED TO RELY ON A MENTOR OR GUIDE. 
It includes a description of Gods personality by means of A TRUE THEOLOGY (based on His description, independently from any philosophical or theological theories, in a straightforward manner and free of false assumptions). GOD IS HUMBLE. HE IS THE MOST LOVING AND UNDERSTANDING ENTITY YOU COULD EVER IMAGINE. HE LIVES IN YOU. HE IS NEITHER WRATHFUL NOR RESENTFUL. HE DOES NOT PUNISH ANYONE. HE IS NEITHER UNCARING NOR SELFISH. YOU NEED TO TRULY KNOW HIM, FOR HE IS YOUR FINAL DESTINATION. 
Finally, you must know your true nature. You are a son of God and possess the same qualities and attributes as your Father (God). As a son of God, you are also a god, though still in a larva-like stage. You live inside a cocoon, but you are of the same nature as God. One day you shall become a butterfly and reunite with Him; that is your fate. You will become one with Him for all eternity. 
These are the three chapters comprising this book. This is the greatest learning experience anyone can aspire to, regardless of their social standing or religionyou could be a rich, powerful man, or you could be the Pope, a rabbi, etc., or even the poorest, humblest and most ignorant man. The fact that we live in a larva-like stage creates a condition of equality: We are all larvae seeking the truthrepresented by God, from whom we originated and in whom we will find our fate." />
