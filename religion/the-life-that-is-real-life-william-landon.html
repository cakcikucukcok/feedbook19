  <title>The Life That Is Real Life - William Landon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What is the most important part of any life? The correct answer to this question holds the key to ultimate success in our living. To be able to answer this question we have to understand what life is truly about. Surprisingly, the &lt;I&gt;Bible&lt;/I&gt; is very clear as to the answer to this question.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In &lt;I&gt;The Life that is Real Life&lt;/I&gt;, Bill Landon explores the basic nature of human life as it is described in the &lt;I&gt;Bible&lt;/I&gt;. While this sturdy is based on Christian beliefs, it is not affiliated with any denomination or organization. In this nontraditional approach to life we will look at the spiritual view of living. This is a view that is not found in most of the world&#39;s explanations of what human life is about.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Why do we need a new view of our living? Most people sense that their living lacks a certain something. Bill believes that something is peace and rest. We are not at rest because we don&#39;t know where to look for these blessings. The good news is that we can begin today to find a way to living with greater peace no matter what circumstances we face. All we need to do is to seek from the right source for the answers. Come and explore the wonderful world of the life that is real life.&lt;/P&gt;" />
