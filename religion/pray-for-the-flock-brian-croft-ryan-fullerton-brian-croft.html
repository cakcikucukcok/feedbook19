  <title>Pray for the Flock - Brian Croft, Ryan Fullerton, Brian Croft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;“Brothers, pray for us.” (1 Thessalonians 5:25). The Apostle Paul’s letters are filled with references to prayer—requests for prayer from the churches, prayers for them, and teaching and encouragement that God was working through these prayers. Pastors and church leaders know that prayer is powerful and it must be a priority in any ministry, yet many pastors struggle to maintain an active prayer life. Even more difficult is the challenge of praying for the flock, lifting up the needs of the people God has placed in your care.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Practical Shepherding series of guides provides pastors and ministry leaders with practical help to do the work of pastoral ministry in a local church. In Pray for the Flock, pastors Brian Croft and Ryan Fullerton provide biblical encouragement, practical advice, and helpful suggestions that will help busy pastors effectively pray for their people and care for their church through the ministry of intercession.&lt;/P&gt;" />
