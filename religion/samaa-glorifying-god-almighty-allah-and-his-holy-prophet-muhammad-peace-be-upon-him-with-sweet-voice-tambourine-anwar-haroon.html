  <title>Samaa’ “Glorifying God Almighty Allah and His Holy Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) with Sweet Voice &amp; Tambourine” - Anwar Haroon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the name of Allah the Most beneficent and Most Merciful
All the praise to Allah and His Holy Prophet Muhammad peace be on him.
Allah says in holy Quran:
Whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the earth glorifies Allah, the King (of everything), Holy, All-Mighty, All-Wise. Holy Quran 62:1
Since I read this verse of Holy Quran and its meaning, I was pondering while everything in the universe is praising Allah almighty, why are we not able to hear it?
As my thinking and knowledge matured, I realized that every element has a molecule and its own atomic structure with its own nucleus with electron, proton and neutron which forms the particular element. Few electrons in the atomic structure circulate around its nucleus which can be seen with the help of an electron microscope. Then I realized that each element has a life of its own and human ears are unable to hear the movement of the electrons in it.
It is surprising as Holy Quran mentions that the animal beings, plants, mountains, and the birds used to join Prophet Dawood (David) alaihissalaam in his praising of Allah Almighty and the mountains would swing.
It is also said, that a camel had complained to Holy Prophet Sallallahu alaihi wasallam about his master mistreating him. 
It is also said that the plants moved away with their roots to cover Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihi wasallam when he had to attend to natures call in a field.
It is said that Hazrat Ali raziallahu anhu could tell what the conch said when it was blown.  
Hazrat Jalaluddin Rumi went into a trance upon hearing the rhythmic sound at the shop of a gold beater.  
It is also proven that music even affects the milk-giving animals to increase its output, load-bearing animals can carry load without getting tired early, hunters catch the deer that go under trance of music and even plants bear more fruits.
Well, the best rhythmic sound is of pronouncing the verses of Holy Quran with the best human voice, which was even liked by our Holy Prophet Peace be on him. Even the kuffar, non believers, used to hide and hear the recitation of Holy Quran and enjoy it. Next enjoyable is poetry with meaningful words and later is the music created by lifeless instruments.   
Our Holy Prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam has permitted singing with tambourine. He, peace be on him, used to enjoy good poetry and he even permitted his companion Hazrat Hassaan bin Thabit to recite a poetry condemning kuffar sitting on the pulpit of the mosque.
Music is permitted in almost all religions and the Hindus of India in particular have developed it as an art. The Muslim Sufis of Chishtia Tareeq have also adapted rhythmic poetry and Hazrat Ameer Khusroo, may Allah bless him, has invented certain Raagaas and even developed certain musical instruments. Hence it is proven that lifeless instruments create rhythm which praises Allah Almighty. Even human beings praise Allah Almighty and His Holy Prophet peace be on him through their rhythmic poetry, which serves them to get closer to Allaahu Taala.
It should be noted that music could be even used wrongly by people just to satisfy their lust and increase their devilish thoughts. For this reason, the Sufis have laid certain rules to gain only the spiritual benefits and keep them away from its negative effects.  It is still seen that few deviated Sufis are using music for a wrong cause and this has to be stopped.
In this context, I have collected quotations from Holy Quran and Ahadeeth, sayings of famous and rightly guided scholars and Sufis on the topic Rhythmic poetry and music. I hope this booklet shall remove the misunderstanding from everyones mind and provide guidance. 
I pray that Allah Almighty be pleased and accept my endeavors in this regard and may Allahu Taala send His praises upon His Holy Prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam and his progeny and companions, Aameen.
