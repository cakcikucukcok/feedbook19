  <title>Finding Freedom in God’S Promises - Beth Gable Hicks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After I wrote my last book, The Importance of Christian Friendships: In Good Times and in Bad, I began to think about how many of the attributes of Christian friendships are grounded in faith.  This is the same faith that leads us to believe in Gods promises. 
I dont know if you have ever tried to count how many promises there are in the Bible; they are almost impossible to numerate! Yet that did not dissuade me. I began to turn to the Bible and meditate on some of the more significant promises. Then I began to ask myself how my life would be different if I truly believed Gods promises? What if we all believed Gods promises and acted accordingly? 
I am convinced that if we have faith and believe in Gods holy nature, we can then accept that He is who He says He is. It is then just a short step to knowing that He will do what He says He will do, and we can trust in His promises. 
Gods promises are very precious. Not only do they remind us of His personal interest in our lives, but they provide us with hope and encouragement. I would also contend that accepting His promises turns religion from something that seems restrictive to something that is truly liberating. 
As you will read in the book, we can find freedom in Gods promises. We can find freedom from condemnation, freedom from want, freedom from fear, freedom from hopelessness, freedom from grief, and freedom from worry, just to name a few. 
I hope the reader will find renewed encouragement from this book and new faith in a faithful God." />
