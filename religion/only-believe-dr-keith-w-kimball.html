  <title>Only Believe - Dr. Keith W. Kimball</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Where is the church now compared to fifty years ago? Is our faith stronger or weaker? Is the churchs influence what it used to be? If not, why? We need to understand that as goes the church, so goes the nation. God has called the church to be the headnot the tailleading society to His throne of grace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Only Believe&lt;/i&gt; is dedicated to revealing the heart of God according to the Bible for revival, a stronger personal relationship with Christ, and more effective church growth. The reason for our national dilemma, how to have a personal relationship with Jesus, and the biblical answers to other questions are included and backed up by the authority of Scripture. I pray that &lt;i&gt;Only Believe: Drawing Closer to God&lt;/i&gt; will lead you to personal spiritual introspection as you take this spiritual journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keith Kimball has combined his vast Bible knowledge with many years of experience to compile one of the most practical and pertinent books for our day: &lt;i&gt;Only Believe&lt;/i&gt;. His premise is so basic, and yet so overlooked by a generation which seems to be on a quest to sensationalize the message at the risk marginalizing the truth. New believers as well as seasoned saints will be blessed as they are challenged to simply believe the life and work of Jesus and to simply obey His commands.&lt;br&gt;
Royce E. Williams, evangelist, Missions Evangelism Ministries&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keiths book carries out a word he uses in one of his chapters: simplicity. He uses the great truths of the Bible to challenge the reader to apply them in their quest to draw closer to God. A good read.&lt;br&gt;
