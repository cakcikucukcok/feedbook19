  <title>Glory in the Mountains - Fred B. Lunsford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;u&gt;Glory in the Mountains&lt;/u&gt; is not about me or any other earthly person or persons. Many people are mentioned in this book, but the book is about God and what He has done in and through my life and in the life of others.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I could write volumes about the times I have failed, gone the wrong direction and made bad decisions. God always does the right thing in the right way at the right time. He never fails.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In my journey, His voice has been like the sounds of many waters. At times, it&#39;s peaceful and serene, then furious and demanding. That voice has been a source of strength for me through the years. I hope this little book will help someone stop and listen to His voice." />
