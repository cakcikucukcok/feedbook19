      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As Zelma was lying in her bed about three oclock in the morning, meditating on the Lord and on her ministry, the anointing of the Holy Spirit came over her and took control of her mouth. As she cried out to God, the words she said were so unusual and the answer that she got from God was totally out of the ordinary, she said in a loud voice, God! what is my calling and show me how to use it. The answer that she got was unacceptable, and she could not believe it because that was not what she had been taught in the church. Therefore Zelma rebuked it in the name of Jesus, and she said, If thats the way hes going to talk, Im not going to ask him nothing else. God told her what her calling was, however he didnt tell her how to use it, and she wasnt about to ask him how to use it. She was offended at his answer. But five years later, God showed her how to use her calling, and it was awesome. It was revelation knowledge that only God would know how to tell you.&lt;/p&gt;" />
