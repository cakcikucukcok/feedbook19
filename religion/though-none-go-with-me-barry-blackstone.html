  <title>Though None Go With Me - Barry Blackstone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Though None Go With Me is a series of observations and challenges as seen through the eyes of a Maine pastor on his first trip to India. Barry Blackstone taught for forty days at a Bible college in Kerala State in India. Here he shares his insights on the cross-cultural adventure that has forever changed the way he sees missions and the support of native works in other lands. This book includes flashbacks to youthful days. (Rural India takes the pastor back to his own boyhood in northern Maine.) In India Blackstone faced challenges with language and food, and even a broken tooth. Here each story Blackstone offers is a devotional that brings to light deeper spiritual meaning and insights--more than the actual experience itself. This book also tells of the impact the pastor&#39;s trip on people of his own church in Ellsworth, Maine, and of what they did to forge a link between a small church on the coast of Maine and a small church in the hills of southern India!" />
