  <title>The Last Avatar of Jesus the Christ - Aden John</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Greatest Thing we can ever possess in this life . . .
The Greatest Joy we ever may retain in this life . . .
The Most Wonderful attainment all Created mortals may yet ever know in their lifetime . . . is;
To LOVE GOD!
- With all our heart, with all our soul, and with all our might . . .
Irrespective of the vast myriads of belief systems, the most important Truth in all existence and in subsistence is The Pure All Absorbing Love of God. Irrespective of the human nomenclature assigned to This Incomprehensibly Pure Love of God; he who indeed Loves The One True God Whom he undoubtedly regards as THE SUPREME HIGHEST; he is he who knows that human tongues, languages, and relational differences can never amount into a force strong enough to erode That same Pure Love For God Planted inside his heart by The God he regards as THE SUPREME HIGHEST.
Whatever nomenclature any mortal may have assigned to be That Pure Love of Godto any
indivisible or divisible fragments, if any man claims to have This same Pure Love for God; such a man in Totality can never ever deny The Truth that in Jesus The Christ alone resides The Grand Summation of All The Representations of all Gods Love. Amazingly, the human nomenclature any set of people may have assigned to their Love For God may be different from that which another set may have assigned. If, therefore, language, tribe, race, or just about anything of human affiliations and origins stand as a dividing difference between humans who claim to have That same Incomprehensibly Pure Love for God; it then becomes questionable whether That Love they claim to have for God was Genuine and homogenous or not.
If a man says he Loves God, but for whatever reasons known to him, acknowledges not The Last Avatar Whom The God he claims to Love has sent; then it becomes obvious that such a man willfully chooses to understand his Love for God in ways which he freely desires and not in the Simple way which has been revealed unto him. How then would he cope when That Love of God Decisively Judges the free wills of all humans?
