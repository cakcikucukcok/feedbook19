  <title>Where Faith Meets Culture: A Radix Magazine Anthology - Sharon Gallagher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Where Faith Meets Culture is a Radix magazine anthology. What does Radix usually contain? Interviews and features. Reviews of significant books, films, and CDs. Informed opinions in The Last Word. Eye-catching graphics. Mind-stretching prose. Image-rich poetry.   Radix assumes that Christians live in the real world and takes lay Christians seriously. As one subscriber wrote: Radix is a more worldly magazine than one would expect from its deep commitment to Christ. Radix monitors the cultural landscape, questions assumptions, and introduces new voices, remaining deeply rooted in Christ.  Sociologist Robert Bellah wrote in a Radix article: Though social scientists say a lot about the self, they have nothing to say about the soul and as a result the modern view finds the world intrinsically meaningless. Radix continues to talk about meaning and hope in a culture that has lost its way.  The articles in this volume reflect the magazine&#39;s wide-ranging interests: literature, art, music, theology, psychology, technology, discipleship, and spiritual formation. They&#39;re written by some of the outstanding authors whose work has graced our pages over the years: Peggy Alter, Kurt Armstrong, Robert Bellah, Bob Buford, Krista Faries, David Fetcho, Susan Fetcho, Sharon Gallagher, David W. Gill, Joel B. Green, Os Guinness, Virginia Hearn, Walter Hearn, Donald Heinz, Margaret Horwitz, Mark Labberton, Henri Nouwen, Earl Palmer, Susan Phillips, Dan Ouellette, Steve Scott, and Luci Shaw." />
