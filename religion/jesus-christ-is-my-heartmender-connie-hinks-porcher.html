      <meta name="description" content="For over 30 years, these treasured poems have resided in a plain white notebook, largely unseen by the world. These poems were whispered to Connie by the Lord, written down on paper and shared with just a few special people. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
As Connie has experienced the mending of her heart by Jesus Christ, so she has felt the leading to reach out and mend other hearts with the same love she found when she came to know Him. She has counseled women for many years and has a tremendous love and compassion for the hurting. For the last few years Connie has felt the Lords leading to put her poems into print with two purposes in mind: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
to encourage those who are struggling &lt;br&gt;
and to glorify the God she loves, the Master Heartmender. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
May these words touch your heart and bring joy, peace and healing to your soul. May you come to know Jesus Christs immeasurable love and may He become your Heartmender." />
