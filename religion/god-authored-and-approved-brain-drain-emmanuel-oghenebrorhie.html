  <title>God Authored and Approved Brain Drain - Emmanuel Oghenebrorhie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The term Brain Drain or Best Brains Drain/carting away is only a
derogatory reference to God intended concept of maximizing the
spectacularly skilled persons He sent to live and add great value to
mankind in each generation. It is peddled by persons who have failed in their
responsibility to manage such special God-sent individuals to benefi t themselves
and their territory optimally. When some fail examinations, rather than take
responsibility for their poor performance and double their efforts to turn their
failure in their success, they would choose to fi nd fault with the examiners,
script markers and graders. The two major ways to stop acclaimed oppression
is either to make the oppressor stop any how or resist the oppressor into
stopping. When Laban would not stop cheating Jacob, commonsense made
Jacob opt to withdraw his services from Labans employment without notice.
He did not continue to shout blue murder without doing something tangible
from his own end. In fact, Jacob did not waste his time seeking mediation by
the elders or leaders and rulers of Labans nation of Haran also known as
Padan-Aram. Some call it taking charge of how others treat you. Prolonged
accusation of being oppressed is a sign of weakness or laziness, foolishness,
planlessness, and even outright stupidity. After prolonged mourning over being
mocked for childlessness, Hannah made concerted effort to put an end and
God blessed her effort to the regret of her mocker and maligner. Enjoy a happy
reading." />
