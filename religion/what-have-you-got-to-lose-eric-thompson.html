  <title>What Have You Got to Lose? - Eric Thompson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When you are tired of losing, it is time to stop being entertained and start being educated.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The answer to the question posed by the title of this book comes in three parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is that when all else fails, you have nothing to lose except the failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second is that when all else fails, you have tried nothing but failing methods, and those methods must be left behind if you wish to achieve happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last is that most people dont have a clue as to what it is that they have to lose. They would be well advised to learn exactly what the consequences of that loss would be before they act and find out the hard way. Failure is far greater than not achieving a goal.&lt;/p&gt;" />
