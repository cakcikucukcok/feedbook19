  <title>Theosis: Patristic Remedy for Evangelical Yearning at the Close of the Modern Age - Michael Paul Gama, Gerald L. Sittser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Evangelicalism is reaching an inflection point. The exodus of millennials from Evangelical churches and the growth of those self-identifying as &quot;Nones,&quot; as in &quot;None of the Above,&quot; for their church affiliation, is concerning for the movement&#39;s future. Evangelical leaders offer mixed responses to this challenge--from circling the wagons to an enthusiastic &quot;Everything must change!&quot; posture.  Theosis takes a different approach. Seeking to understand Evangelicalism and its origins, this book suggests that Evangelicalism is best understood as the sibling of western, Enlightenment Modernity, which served it well . . . until the modern cultural ethos began to shift dramatically toward post-modernity.  In this shift, young Evangelicals--principally postmoderns themselves--are abandoning &quot;their father&#39;s Evangelicalism&quot; and its perceived linearity, hyper-rationalism, either/or exclusivity, and faith expression, too often perceived as stripped of mystery and wonder. Theosis proposes that to move forward, Evangelicalism must go back to the future, to re-engage with the patristic understanding of salvation as theosis; deification, or union with God.  This radical return--and broadening of the doctrine of salvation--has begun to gain traction in Western Christendom, slowly being considered as it has always in the Christian East, as mere Christianity." />
