  <title>Reflective Poetry for the Spirit - Alan R. Olmsted</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Living in the presence of God is a high honor, a privilege, and the glorious life of a Spirit-filled believer who is committed to God. This poetry uses imagery that expresses a spiritual walk or journey with God, our Creator. Talking to the Lord, sharing with Him, cultivating friendship and intimacy with Him, while maintaining obedience to Him, are gateways to being in His presence. Listening and yielding to the Lord and worshipping Him are important ingredients in having a spiritual relationship with God. Think of prayer as being in His presence, facing Him, talking to Him, but remember that He is Creator, our heavenly Father, and we are His creation, made in His image. We must give Him admiration, praise, and our yielded selves to Him.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;These writings express a longing to be with God and walk with Him on the highest plane possible. You can live in Gods presence. You can aspire for the mountain peaks and get there in Gods grace. God desires for us all to come in to His presence. God is calling you.&lt;/p&gt;" />
