  <title>Year with God - Richard J. Foster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Many people are longing to find the footprint of God in their daily lives. This beautiful daily companion is comprised of 365 selections of scripture&amp;#44; commentary&amp;#44; meditations&amp;#44; and daily exercises to help readers see how they can bring their entire life into a life with Immanuel &amp;#45; a God who is with his people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Richard Foster&amp;#8242;s best&amp;#45;selling book&amp;#44; Celebration of Discipline&amp;#44; he explored the &amp;#34;classic disciplines&amp;#44;&amp;#34; or central spiritual practices of the Christian faith. Foster showed that it is only by and through these practices that the true path to spiritual growth can be found. In A Year with God&amp;#44; the spiritual disciplines are presented in such a way that does not destroy the soul but enables the reader to enter into a transforming life with God. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Through daily spiritual exercises and meditations&amp;#44; A Year with God explores eighteen spiritual disciplines. The inward disciplines of meditation&amp;#44; prayer&amp;#44; fasting&amp;#44; and study offer avenues of personal examination and change. The outward disciplines of simplicity&amp;#44; solitude&amp;#44; submission&amp;#44; and service help prepare one to make the world a better place. The corporate disciplines of confession&amp;#44; worship&amp;#44; guidance&amp;#44; and celebration bring one nearer to others and to God. Each discipline will be given twenty days of readings&amp;#44; beginning with scripture and followed by commentary&amp;#44; a meditation&amp;#44; and a spiritual exercise. Practicing these spiritual disciplines will help readers live intentionally&amp;#44; contributing to a more balanced spiritual life and a reformation of the inner self.&lt;/p&gt;" />
