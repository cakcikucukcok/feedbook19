  <title>Hurry .... but Don&#39;t Speed! - Ana Raphael</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I have been asked so many times by so many people to explain what Spirituality is. They are usually thinking people who have come to the conclusion that there must be more to life than the hurdy-gurdy of most peoples daily grind. It is always so difficult to put an explanation in a nutshell and whereas I could talk for hours on, what to me, is such an exciting subject, I run the risk of losing their rapt attention if they are just dipping a toe in the water while I am being carried away on my hobby-horse!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So this book is an attempt to put into a slightly larger nutshell just enough explanation to whet those searchers appetites, and hopefully they will come back for more.&lt;br /&gt;
I want to tell people that there is so much on offer out there, enough to keep you in joy, happiness and love for the rest of your lives, you, your families, and your friends. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once you become aware of the amount of loving and healing support that is constantly there for you life takes on a different hue. I could not have weathered the ups and downs of my own particular life had I not been aware of my dearest friends in the etheric behind me at all times.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is in their honour, and with my deepest, most sincere gratitude and love, that I dedicate this book to them, the Lords Lanto, Sananda, Meru and Jophiel who were especially involved in its inception, and gave me such wonderful encouragement all along the line. There are of course, many more beloved Masters in the group that delightfully call themselves my Friends, and who popped in and added their support from time to time. when they thought my self confidence was flagging!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To them all I send my most grateful thanks and very much love for just being there. And it will give me boundless pleasure to introduce them to all of you who feel the stirrings of a desire to know more, in my next book. It is my greatest wish that you have found something that has plucked a string or two in your hearts or touched some memory deep in your subconscious, in this the first book. Please tell me about it, I want to know what interests you and maybe I could add it to the content of Book 2.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I look forward to hearing from you,&lt;br /&gt;
Happy reading and many Blessings,&lt;br /&gt;
