  <title>Preparing the Bride - James A. Cousineau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jesus promised He would come again to take us to be with Him to a place He has prepared for us, and scripture states it is an incredible place and life He has for us, beyond our comprehension. 
We can begin to experience this abundant life and walk in these Kingdom blessings here and now. As we allow the Holy Spirit to work in us, to lead, convict, teach and empower us to live for Christ  we will be prepared for His coming. 
The real question is not when is He coming, but who is He coming for and will I be among those He receives to Himself? 
Concerning these end times and His coming, Jesus said though we wouldnt know the exact hour or day, but that we are to be looking for the signs of His coming  to watch, pray and be ready for Him to come at any moment. 
As we watch, pray, and then do whatever He asks us to do, we will be ready for His coming or our going to be with Him, whichever comes first. The Bride has made herself ready! 
He is coming to take a prepared people to a prepared place, so what does it mean to be ready? In light of the possible imminent return of Jesus, what manner of persons ought we to be/how would we want to be found by Him? 
What sort of Bride does Jesus desire/deserve and will He accept? Who is He soon coming for? 
A Passionate Bride  not cold or lukewarm but deeply in love with and devoted to Him; one looking and longing for His coming, preparing for His arrival, and desiring only to spend every minute in His presence. It is the essence and key to everything we are and do for the Lord. Everything comes down to loving God and others." />
