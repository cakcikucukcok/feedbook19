  <title>Hurting in the Church: A Way Forward for Wounded Catholics - Fr. Thomas Berg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;strong&gt;Hurting in the Church&lt;/strong&gt; provides a psychologically wise and spiritually profound path forward for Catholics who have been abused, traumatized, or wounded by other Catholics - especially those in leadership. Chapter 10 on how to recover one&#39;s belief in and love for the Church is worth the price of the book alone!&quot; -- Sherry Weddell, Best-selling author of &lt;em&gt;Forming Intentional Disciples&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;An honest and much-needed book that addresses ... the many Catholics who feel marginalized, ignored, hurt, insulted and even abused by the Church.&quot;-Fr. James Martin, SJ, author of &lt;em&gt;Jesus: A Pilgrimage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;It took courage for Father Berg to write with such honesty and transparency, and his courage will give you courage-not only to confront sin and weakness within the Church, but also to give God another chance to help you rediscover him within the embrace of the Church despite the failings of her members.&quot;-Fr. Jonathan Morris, author of &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; Bestseller, &lt;em&gt;The Way of Serenity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Here is an unflinching examination of the Church&#39;s brokenness ... along with practical advice and the promise of hope for the challenging path forward. Fearless in his assessment, Father Berg is equally confident that in Jesus and with the help of the Holy Spirit, we can move toward healing and wholeness.&quot;-Cardinal Timothy Dolan&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABOUT THE AUTHOR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Father Berg is professor of moral theology and vice-rector at St Joseph&#39;s Seminary in Yonkers, NY. He earned his doctorate in philosophy at Rome&#39;s Pontifical Athenaeum Regina Apostolorum. In addition to scholarly work in bioethics, he has also been published or quoted in &lt;em&gt;Homiletic &amp; Pastoral Review&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Crisis Magazine&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;First Things&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;. An avid runner, hiker, and cigar aficionado, he escapes as often as he can to Cape May, New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;" />
