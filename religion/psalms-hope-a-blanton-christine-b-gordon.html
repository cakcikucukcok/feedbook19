  <title>Psalms - Hope A Blanton, Christine B Gordon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re a woman who feels like you don&amp;rsquo;t have time to study the Bible in a deep, meaningful way, but you want to, this is the book for you. Psalms is a combination of Chris&amp;rsquo;s ability to unpack Scripture in deep, practical ways and Hope&amp;rsquo;s ability to create questions that guide the reader and apply God&amp;rsquo;s Word. This collection of twelve psalms will help you articulate the deep emotions we experience while living in a broken world. But these psalms may also be more practical than you think. Designed to be completed in just twenty minutes, each study is both substantive and time efficient and is useful for individual and group studies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Christine and Hope&amp;rsquo;s study through Psalms is terrific. It offers readers a chance to bring their longings, laments, and laughter to the Lord by exegetically walking them through the text, while also offering practical application questions and direction to apply each psalm. This study, as with their other studies, is an excellent resource for diving deeper into God&amp;rsquo;s Word by giving guidance through the rich Scripture found in Psalms.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Casey Cockrum, M.S., Director of Female Campus Staff, Reformed University Fellowship&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;The Psalms Bible study provides a 50,000-foot flyover of the middle of the Bible that will make your heart sing! Hope and Chris introduce the various types of psalms in a very accessible and engaging fashion. Their At His Feet Bible Studies are compact yet chocked full of rich theology. They are ideal for new believers, working women, and young moms.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Karen Hodge,Coordinator of Women&amp;rsquo;s Ministry Presbyterian Church in America (PCA)&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;The Book of Psalms is near and dear to every believer. These poems of old put to words the deepest joys and cries of our heart, shaping our faith and helping us worship our Savior. This study on the Psalms dives into the various genres of psalms, verse by verse, helping us worship the One who ultimately fulfills its prose. I highly recommend this study!&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
