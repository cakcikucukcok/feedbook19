  <title>The Works of the Enemy(Satan and His Demonic Forces) - Robert Antwi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Satan and his forces are waging a war against humanity, but the sad thing is, many Christians are not aware of the extent of this warfare. This a spiritual warfare, and the Bible teaches a lot about the works of the enemy and the spiritual warfare, so I decided to write on this topic to bring light to what Satan and his forces are doing in this world. 
The works of the enemy, what Satan and his demonic forces are doing, are well outlined in this book, and I have backed every work of the enemy with the Word of God. Satan and his forces are working twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, four weeks a month, and twelve months a year. They work all the year, without any vacation. The major work of the enemy is to get Christians to sin against God and to diminish their faith in God. In the world, Satan is using money, sex, and power to keep many people from knowing God through his Son, Jesus Christ. 
Money is the root of all evil, so many evil and untold hardship come to fruitful in the name of money. Satan and his forces are working in all the four corners around the world to keep people away from knowing God. One may be praying on a topic for a long time without any answer, then, the enemy will tell you that your God cannot answer your prayers, and if you listen to the enemy, then your faith in God will diminish. Whatever God hates is what Satan loves; for example, God says, I hate divorce, and Satan will say, I love divorce. 
Satan may keep you not only in poverty but in debt. Satan may take away your health, which may come along with sadness and depression. Satan is crafty and cunning, so we may only attack him in the name, which is above any other name in heaven or on earth or under the earth, which is Jesus Christ. As you read on, you are going to see how the enemy is fighting the spiritual warfare with his demonic forces. The Bible tells us how Christians will be able to wage this spiritual warfare against Satan and his forces. Looking at Ephesians 6:1217, For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; And above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. 
Christians are to put on the armor of truth, righteousness, the gospel of peace, faith, helmet of salvation, and the Word of God in order to wage the spiritual warfare against Satan and his forces. This will be more explained as you read on. It is my prayer that you will be able to know more about the works of the enemy and be able to pray effectively to destroy the works of the enemy in your life and the world around you." />
