  <title>Selected Works - Charles Spurgeon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Charles. H. Spurgeon: The man, the myth, the legend.   There are few who can achieve what he has in such a short time. Moreover, few have amassed the written works  as Spurgeon, The few who may be considered are the likes of Thomas Aquinas, Albert the Great,  Bonaventure and Bernard to name a few.  In this effort there will not be a presentation of his sermons, but simply the best of his writings.  In this endeavor, 12 volumes will present only his finest works.  In this fifth volume, the following works are presented:     When Christ Returns-  Words of Wisdom-  Words of Cheer-  Your Available Power-  We trust that you will agree, these are indeed great compositions, and yet to have them in one complete volume is an even better arrangement. The cover is presented since he is known as the &quot;Prince of Preachers.&quot;  In this endeavor, we contend he continually rivals the best of the best and has preached as though he were one of God&#39;s anointed.
