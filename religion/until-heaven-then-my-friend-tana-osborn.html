  <title>Until Heaven Then, My Friend - Tana Osborn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever shed tears at the earthly death of a beloved dog? Have you ever wondered if youd be with your furry friend or friends again? Have you ever dared to look in the Scriptures to find anything at all that might tell you unmistakably that your beloved dogs journey ends safely in heaven? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reassurance you are looking for is found in Gods Word and is brought out in this book. Even though the Bible is meant to lay out the plan for human redemption, there are countless Scriptures that clearly and directly provide a peace that floods your soul, giving you peace and comfort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this wonderfully reassuring book, complete with many photos, it shows us that there is actually a great deal of easily found information telling us that our dog friends will be waiting for us in heaven. There are many Bible teachers that concur, but if you want to hear it straight from Gods Word to give you an overwhelming, confident peace to your spirit, then this book can give you that confidence. It can help you change your good-bye forever to until heaven then, my friend, when I see you again.&lt;/p&gt;" />
