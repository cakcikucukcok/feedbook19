  <title>Call the Roll - Ethel H. Russaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Call the Roll: Laity in the African Methodist Episcopal Church is designed to inform and inspire the reader. From the early days of the Methodist Church in America to the present-day African Methodist Episcopal Church, lay persons have been vital to church health and societal betterment. Following a brief overview of the history of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, highlights of African American lay presence in the early Methodist societies are presented. Four pioneering lay leaders are profiled prior to the introduction of lay persons who made specific contributions to the growth of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. As well, the reader is introduced to a group of AMEC lay persons (including Henry O. Tanner, W.C. Handy, Rosa M. Parks, and Herman Russell) who made invaluable contributions to society. Over 65 references are cited in this extensively researched monograph. 
The reader is challenged to recall with appreciation and respect the contributions of lay persons to the health and growth of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. In addition to lay persons who were first to hold leadership roles in the church, the roll call also pays homage to selected laity who made outstanding contributions to improve society. Call the Roll honors laity in the African Methodist Episcopal Church issues a clarion call for all AMEs to proudly embrace their roots." />
