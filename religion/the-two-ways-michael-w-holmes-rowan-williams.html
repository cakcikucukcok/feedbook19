  <title>The Two Ways - Michael W. Holmes, Rowan Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;How did earliest Christians receive and understand the teaching of Jesus and the apostles?&lt;/b&gt;  These writings, among the earliest used in training new disciples, show a clear, vibrant, practical faith concerned with all aspects of discipleship in daily life—vocation, morality, family life, social justice, the sacraments, prophesy, citizenship, and leadership.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;For the most part,&lt;/b&gt; these writings have remained buried in academia, analyzed by scholars but seldom used for building up the church community. Now, at a time when Christians of every persuasion are seeking clarity by returning to the roots of their faith, these simple, direct teachings shed light on what it means to be a follower of Christ in any time or place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Didache,&lt;/i&gt; an anonymous work&lt;/b&gt; composed in the late first century AD, was lost for centuries before being rediscovered in 1873. &lt;i&gt;The Shepherd&lt;/i&gt; was written by a former slave named Hermas in the second century AD or possibly even earlier." />
