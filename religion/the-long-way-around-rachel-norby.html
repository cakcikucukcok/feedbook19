  <title>The Long Way Around - Rachel Norby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Just when things seem to be going well for Gina and for Brett, both of their worlds come crashing down around them. Gina loses her husband, Andy, to the monster called cancer. Brett loses his wife, Kara, unexpectedly to an unknown heart condition during a tumor removal surgery. Both are left with baby boys to care for and their faith, to which they cling desperately. 
Luckily, the story doesnt end there. Ginas mother encourages her to contact Brett, figuring the two can help each other through their similar tragedies. When Gina decides to heed her mothers advice by sending a letter to Brett, little does she know that her letter of encouragement would begin a friendship and later spark a relationship rooted in faith, understanding, and hope. As Gina and Brett continue their correspondence, the reader watches a touching love story unfold, where God brings beauty out of the ashes." />
