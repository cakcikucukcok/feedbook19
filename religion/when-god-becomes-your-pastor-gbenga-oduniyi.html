  <title>When God Becomes Your Pastor - Gbenga Oduniyi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is the duty of a king to protect and provide for all the needs of his citizens. And now, out of His great love for us, God chose to be our king. Yes, as a result, once you are born again, God has become your personal doctor, defender, provider, father, and shield. Many believers know all these, but only very few in the Body of Christ know that it is also Gods will to be your pastor. 
Truly, God gave us human pastors. We need the services of these wonderful servants of God called pastors in order to manifest whom God had called us to be. However, even the most anointed pastors have limitations, therefore the Lord God Almighty that has no limitation, with whom all things are possible desires to become our pastor. 
Is there any need for you to have God as your pastor? Is it possible to have God as your pastor? Has God been someones pastor in the Bible days? What do you stand to gain when God eventually becomes your pastor? What do you need to do in order to allow God become your pastor? All these among others are carefully taught in this book you are holding in your hand. The revelation in this book will help you to move closer to God and trust Him more without struggling. This book contains revelation that will transform your life and walk with God." />
