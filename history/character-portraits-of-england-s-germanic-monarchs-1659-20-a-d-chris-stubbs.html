  <title>Character Portraits of 	  England’S Germanic  Monarchs  1659-20-- A.D. - Chris Stubbs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Continuing from where we left off in the previous book, we have assembled the Character Portraits of the Hanoverian and Saxe-Coburg and Gotha monarchs of England from 165920-- A.D. As before, these portraits have been constructed by following the authors proposed and previously described method for sorting, combining, and blending interpretations of specific indicators from each of the monarchs epoch and birth charts. Please note that none of the interpretations have come from the author. All points from the interpretations have been included, but duplication has been minimized. Importantly, the unpolished portraits are impartial and consist of relatively modern expressions for appreciation and comparison purposes, but the most speculative, the more mundane, and the least relevant interpretations have been relegated to smaller print. However, the order throughout the portraits remains unchanged. Additionally, all the natal charts, together with corresponding comments thereon, have been assembled chronologically in appendix 1. In case of interest, appendix 2 contains the natal charts of some of those who came close to becoming Englands monarchs within the time frame of the book. Finally, appendix 3 examines the natal charts of the Hanoverian monarchs and of the Saxe-Coburg and Gotha monarchs as separate groups to try to identify specific hereditary traits among them.
Because the author feels that all the portraits from this and from the previous two books fit all the rulers well and specifically, he is tempted to conclude that, for all of us, Character Portraits should be able to provide us with guidance, firstly as young adults, and secondly as parents, soon after a child is born." />
