  <title>Assassination of a Saint: The Plot to Murder Óscar Romero and the Quest to Bring His Killers to Justice - Matt Eisenbrandt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On March 24, 1980, the assassination of El Salvador&amp;rsquo;s Archbishop &amp;Oacute;scar Romero rocked that nation and the world. Despite the efforts of many in El Salvador and beyond, those responsible for Romero&amp;rsquo;s murder remained unpunished for their heinous crime. &lt;I&gt;Assassination of a Saint&lt;/I&gt; is the thrilling story of an international team of lawyers, private investigators, and human-rights experts that fought to bring justice for the slain hero. Matt Eisenbrandt,&amp;#160;a lawyer who was part of the investigative team, recounts in this gripping narrative&amp;#160;how&amp;#160;he and his colleagues interviewed eyewitnesses and former members of death squads while searching for evidence on those who financed them. As investigators worked toward the only court verdict ever reached for the murder of the&amp;#160;martyred archbishop, they uncovered information with profound implications for El Salvador and the United States." />
