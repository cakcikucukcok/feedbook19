  <title>Grandpa’S Us Colonial History to 1800 - Terrence Hagen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Did the American people suddenly become independent on July 4, 1776, or is there something more to our shared history?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;History books tend to simplify the events leading up to the Declaration of Independence, but not Grandpa! Terrence Hagen wants his grandchildrenand everyone elseto know exactly what happened from the founding of Jamestown in 1607 to the time the Founding Fathers broke free from England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is the real America was developed in that period between the founding of the first settlements to the Declaration of Independence. In this history book, youll learn why&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;America could be called an accident; &lt;br /&gt;
self-government was not discovered by America;&lt;br /&gt;
colonial America was the result of concurrent conflict among many entities; and&lt;br /&gt;
subsequent immigration of non-English settlers changed the nature of the American colonist and produced ethnic, religious, and cultural conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laced with chapter summaries, quizzes, and stories of sacrifice, Grandpas US Colonial History to 1800 tells the forgotten history of how the American Revolution was fought not to attain independence but to retain the level of independence early settlers enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;" />
