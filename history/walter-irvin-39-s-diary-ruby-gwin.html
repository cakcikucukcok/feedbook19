  <title>Walter Irvin&#39;s Diary - Ruby Gwin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Irvins story captures a penetrating and epic look at a young Texas boy, whose young years were spent on a small farm near Bradshaw, Texas. In a defining decision, he struck out for California in search of a better life.
The unsettled abusive home environment seems to have guided Walter away from home. Walter was gifted with an inspiring minda person with potential to be. His mother, knowing his difficult stormy life, wanted better for her son and signed for him to enlist in the military.
Walters diary helps to put a face on the World War I Battle at Sea and life of a Pharmacist Mate. He served six years and nine months in the navy, sailing with the fair winds of the sea aboard the USS Saranac. During World War I, Walter served on the Saranac during a dangerous mission that kept all ship crew alert on the United States Mine-Squadron One, North Sea, in fog and bad weather, a task never before done in the world. Walters enlistment and subsquent struggle will fill one with awe of a young man with a passion of proficiency with a deep love of sports." />
