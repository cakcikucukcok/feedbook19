  <title>A Voyage to Virginia in 1609: Two Narratives: Strachey&#39;s &quot;True Reportory&quot; and Jourdain&#39;s Discovery of the Bermudas - Silvester Jourdain, William Strachey, Louis B. Wright, Alden T. Vaughan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To celebrate its fiftieth anniversary, the University of Virginia Press     reissues its first-ever publication. The volume&#39;s two accounts of the 1609 wreck of a     Jamestown-bound ship offer a gripping sea adventure from the earliest days of American     colonization, but the dramatic events&#39; even greater claim to fame is for serving as the     inspiration for William Shakespeare&#39;s last major work, &lt;i&gt;The     Tempest.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;William Strachey was one of six hundred passengers sailing     to Jamestown as part of the largest expedition yet to Virginia. A mere week from their     destination, the fleet&#39;s flagship, Sea Venture, met a tropical storm and wrecked on one of     the islands of Bermuda. Strachey&#39;s story might have ended there, but the castaways     survived on the tropical island for eleven months and-in an act of almost incomprehensible     resourcefulness-used local cedarwood, along with the wreckage of their own ship, to construct     two seaworthy boats and continue successfully on their     voyage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strachey&#39;s frankness about his fellow travelers, mutinies on the     island, and the wretched condition in which they finally found Jamestown kept his document from     being officially published initially, but it circulated privately in London, where one of its     early readers was William Shakespeare. The second narrative in this volume, by Strachey&#39;s     shipmate Silvester Jourdain, covers the same episode but includes many fascinating details that     Strachey&#39;s does not, including some that made their way into &lt;i&gt;The     Tempest.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presented with modern spelling and punctuation, this great     maritime drama and unforgettable firsthand look at the profound struggle to colonize America     offers today&#39;s reader the raw material that inspired Shakespeare&#39;s     masterpiece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
