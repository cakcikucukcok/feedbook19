      <meta name="description" content="Then: Witness to an execution as the disparity, injustice, and cruelty of the  death penalty is carried out. Now: The death penalty is abolished in twenty states.  Then: Geraldine Ferraro was nominated by the Democratic Party to run as the vice presidential candidate. Now: Women are among those seeking the presidential nomination in both major parties.   Then and now: The juxtaposition on a host of major issues present in the 1980&#39;s and the first decade of the 21st century. Is America a religious nation? The abuse of power, the relation between church and state: These are but a few sample of the 31 commentaries addressing issues spanning the decades from the 1980&#39;s to the present. There are some which stand alone without any parallel expression in our day. There is one titled: &quot;Baseball Revisited.&quot;   &quot;The times they are a-changing.
