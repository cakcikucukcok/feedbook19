  <title>Israel and the Western Powers, 1952-1960 - Zach Levey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this study, Zach Levey provides a comprehensive analysis of the development of Israel&#39;s foreign policy during the critical years of the 1950s, focusing particularly on relations between the Jewish state and the three Western powers involved in the Middle East arms race--the United States, Great Britain, and France. Drawing extensively on recently declassified archival materials, Levey challenges traditional accounts of the nature and success of Israel&#39;s policy goals.      By 1950 Israel&#39;s primary foreign policy objective was the creation of a bilateral strategic relationship with the United States. The country&#39;s leaders failed to achieve that goal, though, even after the Suez-Sinai campaigns of 1956. According to Levey, it was this failure that motivated Israel to cultivate ties with the West&#39;s other leading powers, France and Britain. But cooperation with these countries was not the outgrowth of a gradually developing strategic understanding with either one, he argues. Instead, Israel viewed its French and British connections only as temporary substitutes for the desired eventual arrangement with the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally published in 1997.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A UNC Press Enduring Edition -- UNC Press Enduring Editions use the latest in digital technology to make available again books from our distinguished backlist that were previously out of print.
