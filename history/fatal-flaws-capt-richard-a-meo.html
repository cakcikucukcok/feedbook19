  <title>Fatal Flaws - Capt. Richard A. Meo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book and the others in this series are a compilation of hundreds of sources over the past decade. In these pages are stories of people, places, wars, battles and political decisions made and unmade that form the tangled web of History.
 		As the Fire Captain of Eng-34 on W38 Street in Hells Kitchen Manhattan I reported in to the staging area at West and Vesey Street on September 11, 2001. That day I lost 105 of my friends in the unprovoked attacks on our nation. Through those first weeks we recovered the remains of dozens of innocents, and the fallout from that day is still unfolding. 
My first book, My Turn on the Firelines described my years in the FDNY from 1980-2003 including 9/11. The research on that book prompted me to dig deeper into the story of how and why 9/11 occurred.
This series of books, Fatal Flaws describes the interrelated events that shaped our century and of how and why Islamic Fundamentalism began and grew unnoticed." />
