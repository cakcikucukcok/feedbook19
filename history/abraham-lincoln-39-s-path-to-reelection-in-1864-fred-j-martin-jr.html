  <title>Abraham Lincoln&#39;s Path to Reelection in 1864 - Fred J. Martin, Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="PRAISE FOR
ABRAHAM LINCOLNS PATH TO REELECTION IN 1864 
OUR GREATEST VICTORY
Arguably the most consequential election in American history, the presidential contest of 1864 has cried out for a more sophisticated analysis than it has heretofore received. Fortunately, Fred Martins background in political journalism and in banking has enabled him to provide such an analysis in this book, which is a welcome addition to the Lincoln literature. 
--Michael Burlingame, Author, Abraham Lincoln: A Life; Distinguished Chair in Lincoln Studies, History Department, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences University of Illinois, Springfield IL
Fred Martin has written an illuminating account of the roots of Lincolns success as president, culminating in his victory in the critical election of 1864. Effectively using Lincolns words as well as those of his contemporaries, Martin demonstrates how it became possible for Lincoln to overcome his early background and become a skillful and ethical political leader who saved the Union and ended slavery. The book clearly is a labor of love for Martin, a long-time student of Abraham Lincoln. Every person interested in Lincoln and his presidency should have this well researched and well-written book in his/her library.
-- William C. Harris, author of Lincoln and the Border States: Preserving the Union (2011) and Lincoln and the Union Governors (2013).
Fred Martins book, Abraham Lincolns Path to Reelection in 1864: Our Greatest Victory, allows the reader to grasp the magnitude of that election primarily through the words of the actors who battled for the future of our nation during trying times. Mr. Martin brings his extensive background in finance and government to bear, allowing the reader to link monetary policy and legislative process into their understanding of the conflict. His discussion concerning the funding of the northern war effort, the machinations of Secretary of Treasury Chase, and the collapse of the Confederacys ability to finance the war give readers new insights into the economics that drove the outcome of the war and the future of our nation.
