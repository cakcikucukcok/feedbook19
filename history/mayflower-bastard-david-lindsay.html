  <title>Mayflower Bastard - David Lindsay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;David Lindsay, researching old records to learn details of the life of his ancestor, Richard More, soon found himself in the position of the Sorcerer&#39;s Apprentice-wherever he looked for one item, ten more appeared.  What he found illuminated not only More&#39;s own life but painted a clear and satisfying picture of the way the First Comers, Saints and Strangers alike, set off for the new land, suffered the voyage on the Mayflower, and put down their roots to thrive on our continent&#39;s northeastern shore.  From the story, Richard emerges as a man of questionable morals, much enterprise, and a good deal of old-fashioned pluck, a combination that could get him into trouble-and often did.  He lived to father several children, to see, near the end of his life, a friend executed as a witch in Salem, and to be read out of the church for unseemly behavior.  Mayflower Bastard lets readers see history in a new light by turning an important episode into a personal experience.&lt;/p&gt;" />
