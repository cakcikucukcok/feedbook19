  <title>Lessons of War: The Civil War in Children&#39;s Magazines - James Marten</title>
      <meta name="description" content="While information regarding children and their outlook on the war is not abun-dant, James Marten, through extensive research, has uncovered essays, editorials, articles, poems, games, short stories and letters that tell the story of the Civil War through the eyes of children.&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;Lessons of War: The Civil War in Children&#39;s Magazines&lt;/i&gt; is a collection of such items, gathered from popular children&#39;s magazines that were published during this era. The selections in &lt;i&gt;Lessons of War&lt;/i&gt; demonstrate the depth of children&#39;s involve-ment in the war, from raising funds for soldiers to incorporating the war into their play activities and eagerly accepting northern political attitudes.&lt;/p&gt; The era&#39;s leading children&#39;s magazines, such as The Little Pilgrim, The Little Corporal, and Student and Schoolmate, used first-person accounts to let the children of the Civil War tell their own stories. Marten&#39;s commentary illuminates the vision of the Union war effort presented to children as the nation waged war against itself. Sure to enlighten both scholars and students, &lt;i&gt;Lessons of War&lt;/i&gt; is a valuable addition to courses on the Civil War and American social and cultural history." />
