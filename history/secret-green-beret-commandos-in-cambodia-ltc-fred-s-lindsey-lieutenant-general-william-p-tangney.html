  <title>Secret Green Beret  Commandos in Cambodia - Ltc Fred S. Lindsey, Lieutenant General William P. Tangney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We could call this book Special Operations Recon Mission Impossible.  A small group of highly trained, resourceful US Special Forces (SF) men is asked to go in teams behind the enemy lines to gather intelligence on the North Vietnamese Army units that had infiltrated through Laos and Cambodia down the Ho Chi Minh trails to their secret bases inside the Cambodian border west of South Vietnam.  The covert reconnaissance teams, of only two or three SF men with four or five experienced indigenous mercenaries each, were tasked to go into enemy target areas by foot or helicopter insertion.  They could be 15 kilometers beyond any other friendly forces, with no artillery support.  In sterile uniforms - with no insignia or identification, if they were killed or captured, their government would deny their military connection.  The enemy had placed a price on their heads and had spies in their Top Secret headquarters known as SOG. 
SOG had three identical recon ground units along the border areas. This book tells the history of Command and Control Detachment South (CCS).  The CCS volunteer warriors and its Air Partners  the Army and Air Force helicopter transport and gunship crews who lived and fought together and sometimes died together.  This is the first published history of CCS as compiled by its last living commander, some forty years after they were disbanded.  It tells of the struggles and intrigue involved in SOGs development as the modern-day legacy of our modern Special Operations Commands.  Forbidden to tell of their experiences for over twenty years; their After Action Reports destroyed even before they were declassified  surviving veterans team together to tell how Recon men wounded averaged 100 percent; and SOG became the most highly decorated unit in Vietnam and all were awarded the Presidential Unit Citation." />
