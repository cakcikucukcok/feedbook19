  <title>Victorian England: Portrait of an Age - G.M. Young</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This brilliant and evocative book is now widely regarded as the greatest single study of the age in any language. The late George Kitson Clark characterized it as &amp;quot;an historical essay of unique interest and importance.&amp;quot; Though the book deserves to rank as a classic, its allusive style makes it rather difficult fare for the general reader. In less than two hundred pages Young paints a picture so subtle and compact that only the specialist in Victorian history can fully appreciate the value of his vivid narrative. The allusive nature of the Portrait recently sent a few dozen scholars scurrying under the guidance of Kitson Clark, to hunt down and verify its numerous references and quotations. Their exhaustive efforts have unearthed a few minor blemishes, but these fail to detract from the book&amp;#39;s overall brilliance. Thought the Portrait is esteemed by scholars, few have noted how much the book is a reflection of its time and of the abiding cultural concerns of Young&amp;#39;s intellectual life. In print continuously since its first appearance in 1936, this study of the Victorian era from 1837-1901 is regarded as the greatest history of that time ever written. G. M Young&amp;#39;s remarkable survey has outstanding clarity, delicious wit, and penetrating scholarship. &amp;quot;An immortal classic, the greatest long essay ever written.&amp;quot;--Simon Schama. &amp;quot;A magnificent piece.&amp;quot;--Punch. &amp;quot;Every page is delightful reading.&amp;quot;--Guardian. &amp;quot;[A] breathtaking range of scholarship, richness and aptness of language, and acid sharpness of wit.&amp;quot;--Country Life." />
