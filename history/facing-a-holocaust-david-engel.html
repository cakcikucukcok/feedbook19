  <title>Facing a Holocaust - David Engel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Engel&#39;s study will be the definitive statement on one dimension of a very complex problem: the relations between Jews and their countrymen in occupied Poland.--&lt;i&gt;Central European History&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;A superb piece of scholarship that is impeccably researched and most elegantly written as well.--Jan T. Gross, New York University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within this book, Engel concludes his exploration of the Polish government-in-exile&#39;s shifting responses toward the plight of European Jews during the Second World War. He focuses on the years 1943-45, the critical period after the free world became fully aware of Nazi Germany&#39;s plan to destroy the Jews, and shows that the Polish government-in-exile, with its vast underground organization, was a prime target of Jewish rescue appeals. This book is the sequel to Engel&#39;s &lt;i&gt;In the Shadow of Auschwitz&lt;/i&gt;, published in 1987.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally published in 1993.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A UNC Press Enduring Edition -- UNC Press Enduring Editions use the latest in digital technology to make available again books from our distinguished backlist that were previously out of print. These editions are published unaltered from the original, and are presented in affordable paperback formats, bringing readers both historical and cultural value.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
