  <title>The Indian Captive - A Narrative of the Captivity and Suffering of Zadock Steele - Zadock Steele</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the predawn hours of October 16, 1780, the settlement of Royalton, Vermont was attacked by Indians under the command of a British Lieutenant named Horton. The residents were rousted out of their beds by the screaming horde of painted warriors as their once peaceful village was plundered and burned. Murder and mayhem were everywhere. People watched helplessly as their wives, husbands and children were put to death and their homes were burned. They suffered unspeakable pain and suffering at the hands of their attackers. Some were taken captive and forced to march through the wilderness to Canada as prisoners to be turned over to the British or to be tortured and killed. Zadock Steele was taken captive and managed to survive and return to his home. This is his story as told by himself." />
