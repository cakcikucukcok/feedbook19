  <title>The Sixties - David Farber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This collection of original essays represents some of the most exciting ways in which historians are beginning to paint the 1960s onto the larger canvas of American history. While the first literature about this turbulent period was written largely by participants, many of the contributors to this volume are young scholars who came of age intellectually in the 1970s and 1980s and thus write from fresh perspectives.      &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The essayists ask fundamental questions about how much America really changed in the 1960s and why certain changes took place. In separate chapters, they explore how the great issues of the decade--the war in Vietnam, race relations, youth culture, the status of women, the public role of private enterprise--were shaped by evolutions in the nature of cultural authority and political legitimacy. They argue that the whirlwind of events and problems we call the Sixties can only be understood in the context of the larger history of post-World War II America.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents  &lt;br/&gt;&quot;Growth Liberalism in the Sixties: Great Societies at Home and Grand Designs Abroad,&quot; by Robert M.
