  <title>Economic War Circle Ii - Samantha Pague</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Four-star general James Westovers personal account of his military mission to the EU testimony and transcript was about to be read to Congress. The story commences with James, whose commission included being sworn in as honorary judiciary of Economic War Circle or Court. James iterated to Congress that traditional war is in the process of being replaced with electronic warfare. General James Westover stated that a modern virtual private network satellite bank, hosted by a shadow government and its loan portals, were offering 1 percent loans to American borrowers through the Internet. James showed Congress a loan growth-rate chart detailing the loan transactions in real time that indicated the sophistry of the microchips on the rogue electronic warfare satellites that were unprecedented in history. Also, James revealed on a separate cyber attack statistic chart detailing how static and constant the electronic warfare attacks were from one of the economic war satellites that were launched just above the limits in American airspace.
Moreover, he continued, The unabated engagement of cyber attacks that were found to facilitate the siphoning of fractions of a cent in microseconds came from financial data reports presented for Congress by corporations as its primary target. An even more pressing issue are cyber attacks and hacking of computers in the financial industry and Wall Street. Robotic engineering plays a key role on these satellites launched with servers that are sending signals with a constant stream of laser beam attacks at military targets, followed by cyber attacks, which potentially have the power to crack the US economy.
James informed Congress that the electronic siphoning off US currency out of millions of banks and their accounts from all over the world had a direct relationship with the rapidly declining value of US dollar, let alone the siphoning would cause mass inflation. He also told Congress that no legal banking system, enterprise, or military base (wherever it was located) could sustain electronic siphoning off US dollars from their accounts and continue to remain solvent." />
