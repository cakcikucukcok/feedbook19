  <title>One Thousand Roads to Mecca: Ten Centuries of Travelers Writing About the Muslim Pilgrimage - Michael Wolfe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;This updated and expanded edition of &lt;I&gt;One Thousand Roads to Mecca&lt;/I&gt; collects significant works by observant travel writers from the East and West over the last ten centuries&amp;#151;including two new contemporary narratives&amp;#151;creating a comprehensive, multifaceted literary portrait of the enduring tradition. Since its inception in the seventh century, the pilgrimage to Mecca has been the central theme in a large body of Islamic travel literature. Beginning with the European Renaissance, it has also been the subject for a handful of adventurous writers from the West who, through conversion or connivance, managed to slip inside the walls of a city forbidden to non-Muslims. These very different literary traditions form distinct impressions of a spirited conversation in which Mecca is the common destination and Islam the common subject of inquiry.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Featured writers include Ibn Battuta, J.L. Burckhardt, Sir Richard Burton, the Begum of Bhopal, John Keene, Winifred Stegar, Muhammad Asad, Lady Evelyn Cobbald, Jalal Al-e Ahmad, and Malcolm X. &lt;I&gt;One Thousand Roads to Mecca&lt;/I&gt; is a historically, geographically, and ethnically diverse collection of travel writing that adds substantially to the literature of Islam and the West.&lt;/div&gt;" />
