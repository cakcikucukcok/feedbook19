  <title>A Deed So Accursed: Lynching in Mississippi and South Carolina, 1881-1940 - Terence Finnegan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the end of Reconstruction to the onset of the civil rights era,     lynching was prevalent in developing and frontier regions that had a dynamic and fluid African     American population. Focusing on Mississippi and South Carolina because of the high proportion     of African Americans in each state during &quot;the age of lynching,&quot; Terence Finnegan explains     lynching as a consequence of the revolution in social relations-assertiveness, competition, and     tension-that resulted from emancipation. A comprehensive study of lynching in Mississippi and     South Carolina, A Deed So Accursed reveals the economic and social circumstances that spawned     lynching and explores the interplay between extralegal violence and political and civil rights.     &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finnegan&#39;s research shows that lynching rates depended on factors other than     caste conflict and the interaction of race and southern notions of honor. Although lynching     supported the ends of white supremacy, many mobs lynched more for private retaliation than for     communal motives, which explains why mobs varied greatly in size, organization, behavior, and     purpose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resistance of African Americans was vigorous and sustained and     took on a variety of forms, but depending on the circumstances, black resistance could sometimes     provoke rather than deter lynching. Ultimately, Finnegan shows how out of the tragedy of     lynching came the triumph of the civil rights movement, which was built upon the organizational     efforts of African American anti-lynching campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
