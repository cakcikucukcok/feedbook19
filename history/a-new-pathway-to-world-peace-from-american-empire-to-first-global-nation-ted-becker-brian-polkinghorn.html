  <title>A New Pathway to World Peace: From American Empire to First Global Nation - Ted Becker, Brian Polkinghorn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Horrific changes are descending upon humanity, most of them man-made, all of them threatening the survival of humankind on Mother Earth.  Forever wars, the threat of nuclear destruction, the ecology collapsing worldwide, swelling waves of migrants, and unprecedented global inequality of wealth are upon us. The dominant, modern worldview prevailing for many centuries has produced all the above and needs swift and radical change.  Central to this unfolding tragedy stands the United States, boasting its &quot;exceptionality.&quot; Alexis de Tocqueville&#39;s Democracy in America coined and defined how America was an &quot;exceptional&quot; nation. However, the America he lauded in the early 1800s and what it has become today are as different as Antarctica and Hawai&#39;i.  This book is designed to pry open the eyes and minds of people everywhere about the true nature of the US as a spiritual and political (but not militaristic) nation, one to emulate and with whom to collaborate on helping resolve the violence and myopia plaguing humankind right now.  It illuminates a new way to reshape American thinking, and that of the whole world, sensibly and with sensitivity to all humanity and the planet itself. But you must read to the last word to absorb the entire vision." />
