  <title>The Executioner Always Chops Twice - Geoffrey Abbott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A morbidly fascinating mixture of bungled executions, strange last requests, and classic final one-liners from medieval times to the present day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it&#39;s hard to be an executioner, trying to keep someone from popping up to make a quip when they should have spectacularly sunk without a trace. Or to be told that the condemned to the guillotine won&#39;t have a last drink for fear of &quot;completely losing his head.&quot; The business of death can be absurd, and nothing illustrates this better than these tales of the gruesome and frankly ridiculous ways in which a number of ill-fated unfortunates met (or failed to meet) their maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did you know:&lt;br&gt;When Sir Thomas More was ordered to position his head on the block, he said &quot;though you have warrant to cut off my head, you have none to cut off my beard?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the guillotine took three strokes to sever the neck of Isabeau Herman, the mob attempted to stone the executioner to death for cruelty?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the English hanged the pirate Captain Kidd they chained his body to a stake on the Thames River as a warning to seafarers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the strange to the gruesome, from the weird to the completely unbelievable, &lt;i&gt;The Executioner Always Chops Twice &lt;/i&gt;is popular history at its best: witty, lively, and wonderfully bizarre.&lt;/p&gt;" />
