  <title>The 25 Most Influential Aircraft of All Time - Walter Boyne, Philip Handleman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;The 25 Most Influential Aircraft of All Time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; conveys the fascinating progression of flying technology from flimsy wood-and-fabric biplanes to thunderous supersonic wonders. Aviation&amp;rsquo;s most historically relevant and arguably most influential aircraft &amp;ndash; planes like the elliptical-winged Spitfire, the blisteringly-fast X-15, and the ubiquitous Learjet &amp;ndash; are dramatically showcased in individual chapters. Factors like performance, price, operational efficiency, and perceptions in popular culture are examined. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;People are just as important as hardware in the discussion of the world&amp;rsquo;s greatest aircraft. The larger-than-life characters who designed and built these aeronautical marvels &amp;ndash; men like the reclusive Howard Hughes and the demanding Clarence &amp;ldquo;Kelly&amp;rdquo; Johnson &amp;ndash; are an indispensable part of the story. So, too, are the fearless pilots like Charles Lindbergh and Chuck Yeager who gave life to the shining examples of a new and dynamic industry. The authors have flown or flown in many of the featured aircraft and they knew many of the luminous personalities involved, enabling them to share unique perspectives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The preface is written by William Lloyd Stearman, a former staff member of the National Security Council and the son of famed industry engineer Lloyd Stearman. The introduction is written by Norman R. Augustine, the retired Chairman and CEO of Lockheed Martin Corporation. The foreword is written by Burt Rutan, the renowned aircraft designer and founder of Scaled Composites. Each aircraft is magnificently illustrated in color, mostly with paintings by leading aviation artists.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
