  <title>The Tale of Healer Miguel Perdomo Neira: Medicine, Ideologies, and Power in the Nineteenth-Century Andes - David Sowell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This new book tells the story of Miguel Perdomo Niera, a healer whose amazing cures during his travels through the northern Andes in the 1860s and 1870s evoked both enormous hostility and widespread adulation. A combination of narrative and analysis, the book documents Perdomo&#39;s experiences in Colombia and Ecuador and offers valuable insights into the social history of medicine during the Great Transformation in nineteenth-century Latin America. Perdomo&#39;s practice of medicine demonstrated a strong religious influence that liberals thought were incompatible with a modern, secular society. Physicians, formally trained medicos, and those who supported scientific modernization were critical of Perdomo&#39;s practice of Hispanic medicine, even though it was part of the medical system of the day. &lt;i&gt;The Tale of Healer Miguel Perdomo Neira&lt;/i&gt; is a valuable resource for courses in Latin American history and anthropology, and the history of Andean nations." />
