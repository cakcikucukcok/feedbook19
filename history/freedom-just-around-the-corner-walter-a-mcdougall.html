  <title>Freedom Just Around the Corner - Walter A. Mcdougall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A powerful reinterpretation of the founding of America by a Pulitzer Prize&amp;ndash;winning historian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The creation of the United States of America is the central event of the past four hundred years,&quot; states Walter McDougall in his preface to &lt;em&gt;Freedom Just Around the Corner&lt;/em&gt;. With this statement begins McDougall&#39;s most ambitious, original, and uncompromising of histories. McDougall marshals the latest scholarship and writes in a style redolent with passion, pathos, and humour in pursuit of truths often obscured in books burdened with political slants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With an insightful approach to the nearly 250 years spanning America&#39;s beginnings, McDougall offers his readers an understanding of the uniqueness of the &quot;American character&quot; and how this character has shaped the wide ranging course of historical events. McDougall explains that Americans have always been in a unique position of enjoying &quot;more opportunity to pursue their ambitions&amp;#19688;an any other people in history.&quot; Throughout &lt;em&gt;Freedom Just Around the Corner&lt;/em&gt; the character of the American people shines, a character built out of a freedom to indulge in the whole panoply of human behaviour. The genius behind the success of the United States is founded on the complex, irrepressible American spirit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A grand narrative rich with new details and insights about colonial and early national history, &lt;em&gt;Freedom Just Around the Corner&lt;/em&gt; is the first instalment of a trilogy that will eventually bring the story of America up to the present day, a story epic, bemusing, and brooding.&lt;/p&gt;" />
