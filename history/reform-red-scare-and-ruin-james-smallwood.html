  <title>Reform, Red Scare, and Ruin - James Smallwood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Virginia Durr of Alabama was a major reformer whose public career spanned almost fifty years. She fought against the Poll Tax and other restrictions of the franchise that stopped millions of whites and blacks from voting, a development favoring only the Souths aristocracy. She became a leader of the Southern Conference on Human Welfare and the Southern Conference Education Fund. Most notably, she directed the National Committee to Abolish the Poll Tax. As well, she actively participated in the Civil Rights Movement by working with people like Martin Luther King, Jr., and Mary McLeod Bethune.
Because of her reform activism, Durr became a target of J. Edgar Hoovers FBI, Americas secret police, and the House Committee on Un-American Activities. She, along with her husband, was hounded by reactionaries from 1938 through the early 1960s. In the United States in the modern era, suppression did not begin with President George Bush; rather, suppression began much earlier; Virginia Durrs career is a case in point." />
