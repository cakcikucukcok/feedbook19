  <title>PUNCH CARTOONS OF THE GREAT WAR - 119 Great War cartoons published in Punch - Various</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Herein are 119 satirical cartoons published in Punch between 1890 and 1915 which focus on the growing threat of war in the years preceding and during the first two years of the GREAT WAR.&lt;br /&gt;
The cartoons are grouped into the following categories:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Days Preceding the War&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Struggle&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Uncle Sam&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Comedies of the Great Tragedy&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Women and Children First&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The New Rake&amp;#39;s Progress&amp;mdash;Unser Kaiser&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Raider&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Unspeakable Turk&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Italia!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The cartoons encompass all the Allied nations and most of those aligned with the Central Powers. The sea war also features the antics of both navies and of course the sinking of non-military liners.&lt;br /&gt;
During the war the media swung into action in effect becoming an Allied propaganda machine. In addition to Punch, Dutchman Louis Raemakers was also proactive in this media. Raemakers cartoons were so effective that he and his family had to flee the Netherlands when the German High Command offered a reward for his capture.&lt;br /&gt;
Working in London he continued to publish his cartoons mainly in The Times and even went on a promotional tour of the USA. It was thought that his many works, which can be seen in the eBooks Raemakers Cartoons of WWI &amp;ndash; vols. 1 &amp;amp; 2, was partly instrumental in changing the opinion of the American public towards involvement in the &amp;ldquo;European&amp;rdquo; war.&lt;br /&gt;
The effect of these cartoons on rallying public opinion before and during the Great War was incalculable and the propaganda machine continued to play a major role in the conflicts following the Great War.&lt;br /&gt;
